  "story": "Dearest Friends, Family &amp; Well-wishers,Hi, I’m Saranya!I was attacked with acid on the 27th April 2010, by a guy whom I refused to marry. I was doing my final year B.Com in Trichy then. I was about to graduate and had dreams of becoming an accountant. But life had completely different plans for me. The acid attack caused severe burns to my face and hands, and I also lost my right ear. My face and hands have been severely disfigured and scarred. That exact moment is a blur. Everything happened so quickly that I couldn’t realize what was happening. At that very instant, I knew that life is never going to be the same.In 2011, the verdict for the accused was released and he was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years. Although the sentence was given long back, there is still a lot of court work that has to be done. My mother works as a maid. She is a very bold lady and has been taking care of all the court work. My father died in an accident when I was just 3 years old.I am now 28 years old. It’s been 10 years since the dreaded incident took place. During my treatment in 2010, the doctors had administered a lot of drugs for the treatment, which took a toll on my kidneys. Hence, I need an urgent kidney transplant if I have any chances of survival. I am currently undergoing dialysis thrice a week. I can’t go for any cosmetic surgery either due to the condition of my kidneys.If I get to live after the kidney transplant, I want to start up my own small venture and empower other women who have been victims to acid attack. I love to travel and try different cuisines. But due to my current situation, I’m not able to do so. Although the society has always been very empathetic, everyone wants to know what happened. It is a pain to relive the same story each day while telling it aloud to people. For this reason alone, I get out of the house only if it is absolutely necessary.Now all I wish for is to live. If I get to live after the transplant, I wish to be more outgoing and live life to the fullest!Currently I am not able to take up any job due to the frequent dialysis and health condition. Till now, I have been undergoing treatment in Chennai. But financial constraints have put a hold on my treatment. The estimated cost for the dialysis and the kidney transplant is7 lakhs.Kindly help me live.We are grateful and will forever be indebted for your timely help!",

  "story": "Battle Against SMAHelp Arya to get the world’s most expensive drug (Zologensma) for the treatment of SMA(Spinal Muscular Atrophy)Arya was one year old when like every other kid she tried to stand but instead started falling on her face while crawling. We were worried because something was wrong as the crawling, scooting Arya suddenly stopped and became weak. In February 2016, she was diagnosed with SMA. We were shattered to learn about the criticality of the disease. I had dreams that she is walking around the house and playing to a point that I could not differentiate between dream and reality.Six-year-old Arya Pathak is a smart, talkative, and playful kid. She loves going to school, playing with friends. Arya has excellent interactive skills and paints very well. She loves to see other children run and has a desire to walk like them one day. SMA is a rear degenerative neuromuscular disorder characterized by the loss of nerve cells that control muscle movement. This loss causes muscle weakness affecting the Arya’s capability to walk, stand, swallow food, and even breathe sometimes. Arya cannot stand or walk and needs support for sitting. She uses uncomfortable spinal braces for keeping her spine straight and gestors for her legs.Arya takes one-hour physiotherapy and occupational therapy at home daily which is very painful for her. She also practices breathing exercises for improving her lung capacity. She has very weak lungs and a low immune system that makes her susceptible to infections. Normal cold accelerates and ends her in ICU for many weeks where she cannot even breathe on her own and needs Bipap support. Recurrent episodes of hospitalization have made her lungs even week. Arya's life expectancy depends on the kind of care she receives.Recently, an expensive drug Zolgensma has been introduced for the treatment of this disorder. The drug costs Rs. 16 Crores. The early she receives treatment more of her muscles we would be able to save. We cannot save our little girl alone and need your blessings and support to get her through this.

  "story": "“ A boy thought that him throwing acid on my body will determine my future. He couldn’t have been more wrong.”Shabnam’s story is nothing short of inspiring. She is a real-life hero who didn’t let one person ruin her life. By rising above a bad incident she made a life for herself. But today she also needs a helping hand from you. Shabnam was just a 20-year-old young girl in 2014, in the second year of her Bachelor of Arts course with hopes and dreams in her eyes. This is when a young boy, a distant family friend of hers approached her for marriage. Shabnam refused to discuss further on the matter as her education was of prime importance for her at the time. However, the young man refused to accept this. He soon started pressuring her to give her a letter of agreement claiming that she will marry him in the future. Soon after, he started following her and stalking her. Shabnam had expressed that she was not comfortable with this behavior and she wanted this to stop. One day, when Shabnam was at home, he knocked on the door and as soon as she opened the door she saw that he had a bottle in his hand with a yellowish liquid. Before she could react or do anything else, her face, eye, ear and skin were burning. He had splashed the acid on her face and she was writhing in pain. Shabnam had to be hospitalized immediately and was in the hospital for 4-5 months where she underwent multiple surgeries. Her education was put on hold and the family shelled out all their savings to save her. After that when Shabnam returned, she resumed her college and completed her Bachelor of Arts degree with majors in Geography. The bright girl later applied for a scholarship and was able to even get an MBA degree from Chennai.Even though she didn’t let him ruin her future, she is still facing the aftermath of the horrific incident. Her hearing is impaired in her right ear and her vision has become hazy in her left eye. She still has burn scars on her chest, arms and face. She needs surgeries on her eye, her ear, face, and laser treatment for her skin. All of this is costing a massive 6,16,791 lakh",

In this context, the role of frontline workers (ASHA workers, Anganwadi workers, ANMs) becomes immensely important for triaging and managing the disease.Project CHHAAV seeks to support India’s frontline community health workers with a basic safety kit, a pulse oximeter, and a pair of thermometers. Support that will allow health workers to mount an effective response to Covid-19 while ensuring their own safety.*Kit cost has been updated as of 1st June and has been negotiated down to Rs 1450 from Rs 1800.*Kit cost does not include the transportation, assembly, and NGO supervision costs.*Basic Safety Kit to be provided to all frontline workers in a rural areas. In addition to the safety kit, oximeters, and thermometers to be given to frontline workers associated with the Department of Health and Family Welfare (ASHA, ANMs, etc.)Small acts when multiplied by millions of people, can transform the world. We urge you all to join hands with us by sponsoring as many kits as you can. You can make donations as low as INR 250. We also accept internationdonations. All donations made from India and the USA are eligible for tax benefits.If you believe in the cause, please do share the initiative with your friends, family and colleagues. If you are interested in contributing a larger sum, please reach out to us at[email&#160;protected].How will the donation help?●Increased safety of frontline workersFrontline workers actively track and follow-up with millions of symptomatic and Covid-positive cases in rural areas daily. Unless their safety is ensured, more than half of India’s population is not safe. Yet, most remain unequipped and fall victim to the disease themselves. A basic safety kit will significantly reduce their risk of contracting Covid.●Effective management of Covid caseload and timely patient referralsSince rural areas are resource-starved, oximeters and thermometers can help the frontline workers in identifying high-risk patients early enough, thereby pre-empting the need for hospitalization. The same pulse oximeters can also be used to manage child pneumonia. Therefore,Project CHHAAV not only aids in managing the current crisis but also hopes to leave a long-term imprint in improving lives in rural India.How are we implementing this project?We have partnered with RCRC (rcrc. in), a network of 60+ prominent NGOs for this ambitious project. Wherever possible, along with these NGOs, we are also closely working with government functionaries to make our efforts more impactful.Who are we?We are a group of faculty, alumni and students at IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Bangalore. The core group of faculty members from IIM Ahmedabad involved in this effortinclude ProfessorsRakesh Basant,Rajesh Chandwani,Pritha Dev,Ambrish Dongre,Amit Karna,Pranav Singh,Rama Mohana Turaga,Arun SreekumaandAnkur Sarin. The core team from IIM Bangalore includes ProfessorsManaswini Bhalla,Dalhia Mani,Prateek Rajalong with Ms.SangithaKrishnamurthi and Ms. AshaThampyfrom the IIMB community.For more details on this project, please visit this link or contact us at[email&#160;protected].",

We do not turn any patients away and we strive to provide exceptional care to all of our patients, but this surge has stretched our limits. With your help, we can increase our COVID care capabilities by 50% or more to cope with this influx.Chazhikattu Multi-specialty (CMS) Hospital was founded in 1933 and is one of the oldest rural hospitals established in India. CMS has expanded to be a multi-super specialty hospital that has NABH (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals &amp;Healthcare Providers) pre-accreditation. CMS has 8 major operating rooms, 64 medical and surgical Intensive care beds and clinical laboratory with NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing &amp; Calibration Laboratories) recognition. Unlike other medical institutions, wedo not demand advance deposit payments for emergency medical or surgical care.Our biggest strength is our dedicated staffof 500+ which includes medical, paramedical, administrative and support staff working tirelessly towards providing the best treatment and patient care. Relevant patient care statistics of CMS hospital yearly:Emergency room visits of 20,000+Outpatient visits of 200,000+Inpatient visits of 10,000+Surgical procedures of 3300+Labor and deliveries of 1000+Chazhikattu Charitable Trust withregistration number: 83/IV/2009 &amp; IV/98/2014 (amendment) was established in 2009complying to all the rules and regulations of the government of India. Through donationsreceived, the trust continues to alleviate the financial burden of the needy patients.WHY DO WE NEED HELP?During these unprecedented times, our CMS healthcare workers are at the frontlines. The current Covid-19 pandemic with its second wave has significantly overwhelmed our local healthcare system:1. COVID care has taken priority over the regular continuous health needs of the peopleand the emergency medical care.2. Already stretched financials are being further strained, as the care of COVID patients in the hospital requires expensive medical support.3. Overburdened limited medical and para-medical staff are working around the clock ina constrained and under resourced environment.Before COVID testing facilities were availablein the region, our hospital was the among the first in the district to handle suspected COVID cases. We started an exclusive fever clinic, covid antigen &amp; RT-PCR testing facility, isolation wards,dedicated COVID operating theater, labor room facilities, dialysis care, intensive care services &amp;a COVID vaccination facility.We have treated over 8,000 covid patients in 2020 through the monthof December.On the community care front, we’ve initiated telemedicine services and home care visits for patients with transportation limitations, parents without children at home, and those who live alone without family support. Services provided include physical evaluation, laboratory testing and home delivery of medicines and supportive therapy aids. Right from the start, CMS Hospital’s clear motto has been ethical, affordable and quality medical care—a legacy we carry still to this day.Yours sincerelyDr. Joseph Stephen Chazhikattu, F.R.C.S.Managing Trustee",

  "story": "With the 2nd wave of COVID-19, India witnessed an outrageous Oxygen shortage everywhere. People affected by the virus desperately needed Oxygen, which continued to be scarcely available and the situation continues. Countless people lost their lives due to shortage of oxygen and many were forced to beg, borrow or steal oxygen to save their loved ones. Even hospitals were finding themselves helpless as the oxygen supply discontinued many a times. It was really heart breaking to see so many people die because they were not able to get oxygen on time or they couldn't get it at all. Rural areas are worst affected as the heath infrastructure is minimal there.The health pandemic authorities have warned us about a 3rd wave. We must be prepared before we get the slightest hints of the beginning of the 3rd wave. My endeavor is to manufacture oxygen concentrators in India with locally available components to keep it cost effective and readily available. This will be my little contribution to the country if I can save some lives. I need your immediate strong financial support through this fund raiser drive so that I can get on with the production earliest. I can't do this without your help. Being a part of society, it is our duty to help and save lives of as many as we can. Please donate whatever amount you can. Every donation counts.Thanks!",

  "story": "“Gone from our sight, but forever in our hearts”Words seem too small to express the unfortunate demise of Shri Mudit Saxena, Indian Economic Service (IES) -2009 Batch. He was tested COVID positive on 27th April 2021. He fought a long battle during the times when the entire nation was grappling with the second wave and breathed his last on 26th May 2021. He was only 40 years old.He left behind a grieving family of his wife (Ms Namita), 8-year-old daughter (Chhavi) and four ageing parents. This has been the worst phase for the family, as not only he but his entire family tested COVID positive. They tried to recover from COVID through medication and home quarantine initially as it was extremely difficult to find ICU and oxygen beds. However, just in a couple of days, the condition of the family deteriorated to an extent that they required hospitalization. After rigorous efforts from all directions, especially from his workplace, some medical assistance in form of hospitalization was made available for him and his family members. All of them were admitted to different hospitals for COVID recovery. It is extremely painful to share that Namita, w/o Mudit was discharged on an emergency basis from the hospital the day Mudit passed away. Today, the rest of the family members have all been discharged from the hospital and are recovering at home.Mudit’s career journey started with the Ministry of Statistics as a Group C officer where he met Namita. Thereafter, he worked as an Economist with Punjab National Bank for some time after which he made the Indian Economic Service which is a group ‘A’ job in the Government of India. Namita, his wife had been with him throughout his journey of career advancement. Mudit was the strongest pillar of the family. He has been an outstanding, extremely talented young officer and a wonderful human being who has left us too soon. In very short span of his career in Indian Economic Service he held many prestigious positions including Assistant Director in 2013 in Multilateral Division of Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance where his hard work was acknowledged by Dr. Raghuram G. Rajan, Chief Economic Adviser to GoI then. He was a very generous and hardworking individual who brought positivity in every situation. He had a rare quality to go out of his way to help others. Mudit played a significant role and contributed tremendously during his stint as Additional Private Secretary to the Hon’ble Minister of state for Railways and Hon’ble Minister of consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution in the recent times. He, with his dedication and efforts, has set an example for other officers to follow and achieve. His work has received recognition of present Chief Economic Adviser to Government of India, Dr. Krishnamurthy V. Subramanian too. He had miles to go but then he has left all of us too soon.The funds raised will be utilized towards the following;For Settlement of Mudit’s medical expenditure. The family has spent over 15 lakhs at the hospital.To pay for the educational expenses of Mudit’s daughter, Chhavi. To cover the medical expenses of Mudit’s and his wife’s aged parents.No matter how big or small – to help ease some of the financial burdens of this unexpected situation and allow the family to focus fully on what matters most, kindly contribute. While no measure of money could amount to what he means for us, this fundraiser is an endeavor to cherish his memory and ease the financial burdens of his family until they can get back on their feet.",

  "story": "Gandhi Hospital is a multispecialty healthcare facility situated in South West Delhi with a mission to cater accessible, affordable, and quality healthcare to middle and low-income groups.However, our mission is continuously challenged during the ongoing pandemic.Nevertheless, we have treated over 2000+ patients over the past year and continue moving ahead with the same enthusiasm.The second wave of COVID-19 that began in April 2021 left the healthcare system gasping for oxygen.Hospitals like ours and many others overcame grave hurdles daily to save precious patient lives.Some of the challenges being hospital beds, medication, and PPE shortage, overburdened staff with fear of contracting the virus themselves, inflated cost of healthcare supplies, and the gravest of them all: The Oxygen Shortage.We have lost our loved ones, a long-standing employee, and have witnessed parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, children, and young adults among many others who succumbed to this deadly disease. However, what is not acceptable to our hospital is: A patient life lost due to the lack of oxygen. Our struggle to maintain continuous supply of oxygen has included relentless efforts to procure oxygen from plants across North India such as those in New Delhi, Haridwar, Hisar, and Panipat. While we were treating ~100 COVID patients daily, our efforts were also diverted to dealing with the Oxygen Crisis that further burdened an already overworked staff. Behind the scenes, on an hourly basis our staff including the doctors were managing all the logistics, truck schedules, and coordinating with district and state authorities to avoid running into an oxygen crisis. We succeeded but many a times our hospital was dealing with oxygen reserves lasting only 30 - 45 mins and a few times we found ourselves with no oxygen for an hour. This whole crisis further burdened our financial resources as the operating cost of running trucks and procuring empty oxygen cylinders increased by ~350-400% and ~3000% respectively.We believe the COVID battle is not over yet hence, we are determined to be better prepared.Therefore, with tremendous pressure on our financial resources, we are making an appeal to you to join us to donate whatever amount you can and amplify our fundraiser wherever you can to help us set up an Oxygen Plant so we can serve more patients and save more lives.",

  "story": "My name is Kanaga Gnana Guru and I am raising 2,50,000 towards the development of an Innovative Online Blood Donors Portal and Mobile Application, where we link blood donors with those who are in urgent need of blood to save their lives.About me,Since the year 2000, I have donated blood more than 40 times. In addition, I pledge my Eyes and Organs. On 4th September 2018, at the age of 2 years, my second child died of a medical ailment. We donated his eyes after his death to allow him to see the world once again. Since I've been having difficulty arranging blood for the needy, every time whoever approaches me in this lockdown 2021, I plan to come with the solution for it.MissionWe started this mission with one idea in mind - connecting people with hearts with those who need a life.VisionTo provide the people of India with safe, appropriate and timely access to blood.What motivates us to make this idea a reality?'Blood Donation is Great Act of Kindness\"Even though India has a few active online portals and mobile applications, there are challenges in reaching active blood donors in the specified State, City, Area, and Blood Groups via the website or mobile applications. We have highlighted the challenges we experienced below:Blood donors aren't available in the cities registered.Donors who have not completed the 90 days should wait 90 days before donating againThis is one of the more difficult responsibilities for them since donors may not be eligible to donate for different valid reasons. They needed to call every blood donor on the list to see whether they are available and ready to help needy patients with blood donation.Information about blood donors has been scattered throughout several web portals, Whatsapp groups, Telegram, and other platforms.Contact information for Registered Blood Banks is also insufficient.As a result, need patients for blood requirements are not getting the right eligible donor at right time, so we come with a solution for the above-stated problem with the help of state-of-the-art technology and communication platform such as Mobile App, Whatsapp, SMS, and Email. Furthermore, we want to make our donor database open to the public and partner with NGOs, hospitals, blood banks, and existing blood donor web portal providers via API Services.Why are we doing this now, and what is our plan?\"Today's blood donor might be tomorrow's recipient.\"We have planned to create a Blood Donors Online Portal, where we link blood donors with those who are in emergency need of blood to save their lives. Those who need blood should register their needs in our portal, and their information will be shared with all qualified blood donors in the blood group, whoever is in the designated region and closest to the hospital, by email, Whatsapp, and mobile alerts. As an outcome, blood donors will be easily alerted, and they will respond to blood requirements based on their availability. This will reduce the current approach of contacting donors through phone calls, and the most qualified donors will be able to donate blood at hospitals/blood banks.Where do you see our idea going in the next 3 years?\"You can share messages, why not blood?\"We have implemented innovative solutions to get through the challenges that come with the immediate and compelling demand for urgent blood needs. While developing our application, we discovered solutions to all of our questions. We began designing the app after doing a thorough analysis and conducting feasibility tests. We proposed a technique that has received a lot of positive feedback and has a lot of traction. To maintain the Web Portal and Mobile App's quality, we are constantly integrating any changes and ideas from the expert research team.How can you help us?\"Every Blood Donor is a Life Saver\"We encourage that you all contribute to this initiative. Even a little donation goes a long way toward completing this project.﻿To finish this project successfully, even one rupee of payment will help to save lives of many in need of blood.I love to hear from you about your support for the \"Online Blood Donor Web Portal and Mobile App.\"Also, if at all possible, forward this to your friends and family.Thanks",

  "story": "The second wave of COVID-19 has escalated the severity of the pandemic tremendously, especially in India. Everyone reading this has been affected by the COVID-19 crisis. However, the ones belonging to the lower socioeconomic strata of society are the ones who have faced the worst brunt. Thousands of children have lost either the only or both of their parents and many of these children have been tragically abandoned with no one to turn to. A humanitarian soul of our society, Akancha Srivastava, has set up a reporting mechanism and is redirectingthese children to a safe space. NOTE- they aren’t all toddlers.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Akancha Srivastava is the founder &amp; director of 'Akancha Against Harassment'- India’s largest social impact initiative for cyber safety, a vertical of Akancha Srivastava Foundation.We've got tremendous support from various media houses across the globe including the likes BloombergBusinessweek, FRANCE 24 English, Times of India, Deccan Herald, BOOMLIVE, Hindustan Times, SBS News, AAJ TAK, KSU, and many more for our work.In early May 2021, her social media accounts and website chatbot were flooded with appeals to help out children who have been left to fend for themselves during the pandemic.The shockwave of the virus has uprooted many families and has added fuel to the fire where the number of orphans was already high and the child-rights violation &amp; trafficking was a critical issue. While this problem had prevailed even before the pandemic, now the kids are having to face it all by themselves, and often no one left to turn to for help.These children are in a state of shock and at the risk of being in physically dangerous, vulnerable situations in these chaotic times. Many of these orphans are at risk of being put up for illegal adoption. Srivastava mentions “Our authorities are overburdened, people are hassled. It's extremely easy in these circumstances to misassign a child to some trafficking racket or an adoption racket.” Ever since Akancha Srivastava Foundation set up a WhatsApp helpline to help out these children, they have been receiving more 100s of calls &amp; messages every single day These numbers reflect the dire situation for the future of our country out there.A safe place with basic resources where these kids can receive love and care is an immediate need of the hour. The organization’s initiative ‘Akancha Child Rescue’ is working on informing the authorities about a 7-year-old orphan to rescuing a mentally disabled girl from a Prayagraj platform, the operations have seen some indescribable challenges but never failed to put the children in a safe space as the first step. However, the magnitude of the problem is enormous and a lack of resources proves to be a major hurdle while striving to help out these underserved children.The help can not &amp; should not stop at simply removing the child from the vulnerable situation. It is important to build trackers &amp; teams in place for there, and we want to help them with long-term solutions so that they can have a safe space.‘Akancha Child Rescue’ intends to build a robust ecosystem to provide immediate medical support, a care package for food &amp; clothes as required as soon as the children are rescued. The process of adoption is a long-winded process in our country. Often times the shelter houses &amp; orphanages need support in terms of food, clean clothes, consulting doctors, hygiene products, beds, bedsheets, etc so that they can take care of these children. Since these children have endured trauma and shock, they also require help with their mental health.This endeavor comes at a massive expense which is unaffordable by a non-profit organization. Lack of funds and resources creates a roadblock in the way of a child receiving timely help. Donations and contributions from the humanitarians of our society can help aid this initiative and ensure that no child is caught in the vicious webs of trafficking or poverty. Every donation, no matter what the amount, will help in saving one life. Even sharing this cause over social media will be encouraging and helpful. So please contribute as the future of many innocent souls is at stake.",

The BiLevel ST from Medicraft is easily adaptable to the requirements of various patients and extremely essential during these times. Each costs Rs 60,000 and the total cost for getting these machines is unaffordable for a non-profit organization.The shortage of funds is proving to be a massive hurdle in getting countless people the necessary help. With the sudden hike in the prices of healthcare commodities, the majority of the population in India is finding it extremely difficult to afford it. We cannot save millions, but you can definitely save one. Please donate whatever you can to give a hand towards countless underprivileged people who have no one left to turn to. Even sharing this story on social media will immensely help the cause. We request you to help out in whatever way possible as we’re all in this together and can get through this, together!",

He was living in Chennai with his wife Rekha &amp; Daughter Dhiya Sri. Like many people during this pandemic, Murali was infected with Covid-19 and was admitted for treatment at Manipal Hospital in Salem on May 15th and he passed away after a long battle with Covid. He wasn’t doing well financially but somehow his family managed to spend a lot of money to try to make him live. But all their efforts were in vain. They spent over Rs.20,00,000 (Twenty Lakhs) and still his wife doesn’t have her husband and his daughter doesn’t have her father either. To add to their sorrow, his wife and daughter are now burdened with repaying the amount spent for the treatment of their dead husband &amp; father. To top it off, they have to worry about how they will face the future too. I hope and pray that none of our families will have to go through such circumstances. With their plight in mind, we appeal to you to open your hearts and share the blessings that God has bestowed upon you with someone in need. Every single Rupee will really mean a lot to this widow &amp; fatherless child. We may not be able to change the world but at least we can make a difference in the lives of our beloved friend’s family and that would mean the world to them.

I have a younger brother who studies in class 6. My parents have not had much education, father does food delivery and mother is a cook. I had started applying for jobs and was that close to my dreams of becoming financially independent and taking care of my parents. Just that close, when my world suddenly collapsed….In December 2020, I was diagnosed with Severe Aplastic Anemia, a condition that can be terminal but curable through Bone Marrow transplant. My family &amp; I were aghast to receive this news, and suddenly that dream of leading a new life seemed to have become a distant dream. We had no experience of handling a major illness and ran pillar to post trying to find a cure for this life threatening disease.Our guardian angel in the name of Dr Arijit Nag of Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata appeared in our lives and is guiding us ever since. He has identified my younger brother Madhab who will be the Stem Cell donor and this operation can be done at Tata Medical Centre. The procedure however is expensive and the cost that he has estimated is around Rs 20 Lakhs($27,000). My parents do not have the ability to provide this amount of money. Their income is just enough for us to meet our daily expenses. I have a government health insurance card but that card does not cover this procedure.The procedure needs to be done urgently. Currently, I undergo regular blood transfusion, but that is a temporary procedure and allows me to buy a little time. Dr Nag tells me that the longer I delay the procedure, the greater is the risk to my life. I know, dear reader, that if you have read this far, you too are my guardian angel and wish me well. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your kindness and I promise that I will make my life count and make you feel proud one day of the role that you played in my life. Thank you and God Bless.LoveMahua",

He was diagnosed at the age of 3 years and since then we tried out several lines of treatment and therapies, but none of them brought about the minimal changes we want to see in my son’s condition. In the past two years, we have seen glimpses of some improvement in my son’s verbal abilities and a marked improvement in his social interaction skills.However, at least twice every day we curse our fate when we witness one of his “MELTDOWNS” – a term used in Autism circles to refer to a brief episode of a panic attack where the autistic patient begins to hit his head with his hands or anything that he can get hold of at that moment. These episodes are harrowing and every time they occur, my spouse and I are filled with unexplainable dread and fear about how gravely he might injure himself before we rush to him and try to intervene.Phase One:With the funds we manage to gather through this endeavour, we shall first try to get Aavismar a new therapy known as MeRT - new Magnetic e-Resonance Therapy available at quite a few locations around the World, but not in India. You can read about it here - https://braintreatmentdallas.com/conditions-treated/autism/ . This treatment costs USD 10,000 and is administered over a period of 6 weeks. I plan to stay at my friend’s residence in Boulder, CO, USA and commute to Denver, CO, USA for the therapy. Our living expenses in the USA could be about USD 5000 during the 6 week period.Phase Two:We would like to admit him in a School that specializes in Autism, where he can be given specialized training and where they have professionals who can respond appropriately during his meltdowns. The monthly residential school fee for one such institute isRs.30,000 per month. It comes up to Rs.3,60,000 per year and we cannot afford such a huge amount. I request you to kindly contribute towards Aavismar's treatment and education.Every penny you contribute will be transferred only to the treatment centre and educational institute by ImpactGuru, so you can be assured that the money you are donating is used only for the purposes declared here.Even a small contribution will help!!!

  "story": "The second wave of the pandemic has set out a shockwave throughout the country and has upturned the lives of countless people. Everyone has been affected by the pandemic in some way and are aware of someone who lost their life. Guru Gobind Singh Foundation is one of the humanitarians who provide a helping hand to everyone in need during these testing times. They need your help to continue their noble work so that we can all get through this difficult time together.With the prevailing conditions, there has been a massive shortage of essential medical supplies. This shortage has escalated their prices and made it unaffordable, risking many lives in the process. Guru Gobind Singh Foundation headquartered at Vijaywada, serving the society for 5 years, now stepped up to provide whatever help they could to anyone in need.The entire country is still gasping for oxygen as thousands line up outside government hospitals in a desperate bid to save the lives of their loved ones. The non-profit organization gets multiple calls every day from people who are in dire need of oxygen and can be saved with timely help. Upon receiving any lead, a dedicated team looks after the verification process to assess the request. After a thorough process of verification and confirmation, a member delivers the cylinder wherever needed and ensures that the patient has received the necessary help.By pooling in all their resources, they currently have 45 refillable cylinders in their supply chain. However, the ever-increasing numbers of COVID positive cases and deaths portray the grim reality. Inspite of multiple organizations and individuals stepping up to help with providing free oxygen, the need is prevalent in various corners of the country.The lockdown also snatched away the jobs of many daily wagers who worked in the informal sector. After more than a year into the lockdown, they have run dry on their savings and have no more avenues left to earn for themselves as well as their families. Guru Gobind Singh Foundation is providing ration kits to them that can help their families survive this critical period. The healthcare staff in government hospitals have been working tirelessly to save as many lives as possible and are stretched out to their maximum capacity. Amidst this, the Foundation has also been providing fresh food to them and ensured that they had water coolers with clean drinking water.While many are being saved with timely medical help, countless others couldn’t. The present circumstances have made it immensely difficult for many families to even afford a dignified funeral for their lost loved ones. The organization has been helping such underprivileged populations perform the last rites of the deceased with respect.Inspite of helping out a huge number of people in every way possible, the need is constantly rising. The cost of every cylinder is at least Rs 25,000 and the cost of refilling one oxygen cylinder comes up to Rs 1500. They get multiple calls every day and are trying their best to not refuse help to anyone. However, funds being a limited resource are proving to be a massive roadblock in their noble work. Your support will be highly appreciated and encourage them to continue with their noble work. No amount is too small and can save someone’s life. Even a share on Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram will provide a helping hand to them. So please contribute in whatever way possible as we’re all in this together and can beat it together!",

  "story": "Scarcity of Resources making the Situation Worse:India faces an extreme shortage of medical staff, COVID-19 vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen concentrators, ambulances, etc. As per media reports, 3.7~4.2 L cases are being reported every day, while the mortality rate per day has already breached the 4K mark. According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the current medical infrastructure facilitates 1 bed per 1,000 people; however, the current demand is 18 beds per 1000 people. Consequently, many of our loved ones are losing the fight against corona as resources are not available when needed the most.Black Sheep’s of Humanity: Oxygen cylinders that earlier used to be available at Rs. 500/- per cylinder have risen to Rs 35,000/- per cylinder. Cremation authorities are illegally charging up to Rs 35,000/- from the deceased person's family. Recently, an ambulance driver charged Rs. 1,20,000/- for relocating the COVID-19+ patient from Gurugram to Ludhiana for just a distance of 350 km. In such prevailing conditions, India’s middle class is finding it extremely difficult to afford reasonable medical care while those living on the margins of the poverty line are left neither with the hope nor resources to survive in this pandemic.Role of an NGO in Fighting the Pandemic: Though the local administration, state, and central government are putting their best foot forward despite all odds,non-government organizations (NGOs) can play a vital role by volunteering with government bodies.Who are WE?Rehras Sewa Society is a registered NGO that arranges blood donation camps, tree plantation drives, financial support to needy medical cases, medical consultancy, health check-up camps, disaster relief, etc. Since its origin, Rehras Sewa Society has managed to cater to 22000+ blood donations and has impacted (saved) over 62000+ lives.Few Accolades:1. Honoured withState Awardby Health and Family Welfare Minister, Govt. of Punjab, in 2020, 2019, and 2016.2. Honoured withCOVID Warriors Recognition Certificatein 2020 by Punjab State Blood Transfusion Council.3. Honored by the Govt. of Punjab (Ludhiana Administration) for rendering“Best social services to society”in 2019.Ongoing COVID-Relief Activities by Rehras Sewa Society:1. Arrangement of Plasma/Blood Donor and means of transportation.2. Delivering food, water, and other essential amenities to COVID-19 patients.3 . Distributing Mask and PPE kits to front-line workers and needy patient attendants.4 . Regular sanitization of contaminated places, including hospitals.5. COVID-19 awareness help desk at Civil Hospital, Ludhiana.NeXt AcTioN PlaN:As a helping hand to society, we plan to put anAmbulance Sewa(oxygen cylinder included) for the COVID+ patients. Besides, we aim to set up a10-bed hall(Oxygen Bank) with essential commodities likeoxygen cylinders,oximeters, etc. We will appointmedical staff to monitor the health of the patients day and night.Guru Ka Langar (free meals), water, andbasic amenities (soap, sanitizer, masks, etc.) will be provided to the patients, patient attendants, and front-line workers. Conclusively,Rehras Sewa Society will not charge anything (free of cost) to the patientsfor using these facilities: home pick-up to the Oxygen Bank, treatment, meals, and other facilities, drop at home.With the blessings of GOD and your kind help in donations, we intend to execute our proposed model of COVID-relief in an attempt to assist at the right time to the needy.Following is theapproximate cost (INR)which will be incurred to execute this COVID-relief welfare initiative.1. Ambulance– Rs. 14,00,000 (Tata Winger)2.Ambulance Driver Salary– Rs. 90,000 (6 months)3.Ambulance Fuel Expenses– Rs. 2,10,000 (6 - 8 months)4.Oxygen Cylinders– Rs. 40,000 (Quantity 5)5.Oxygen Concentrators– Rs. 6,00,000 (Quantity 10)6.Beds– Rs. 60,000 (Quantity 10)7.Food, Water, and other supplies– Rs. 90,000 (3 months)8.Pulse Oximeters– Rs. 14,000 (Quantity 10)9.Medical Staff Salary– Rs. 60,000 (2 Staff, 3 months)10.

COVID+ patients, their families, and front-line workers will be able to access these resources at the most critical time.How long will this Sewa (AID) continue?We hope to save as many lives as we can by God’s grace through our small initiative, but we need your help. This Sewa (AID) will continue as long as the requirement prevails and the funds are available with the NGO.What if we receive donations more than the goal amount?We look forward to receiving wholehearted contributions as we plan to install an interactive Covid-19 ward for children. Besides, we will use your donations to handhold local NGOs working at the ground level in villages. We also plan to increase the number of ambulance and oxygen concentrator-equipped beds.Testimonials:Our efforts to help the community are acknowledged by various personalities, including Health Minister of Punjab (Sh. Balbir Singh Sidhu), renowned environmental activist (Sant Balbir Singh Seechewal), Chief Medical Officer (Ludhiana), model (Ms. Preeti Jhangiani), singer (Mr. Garry Sandhu), deputy commissioner (Ludhiana), and many others prominent public figures.

While many have faced the repercussions on their physical health, countless others have faced a deterioration of their mental health. Amidst these chaotic and testing times, we have people like Ridhima Rele who are trying their best to lend a helping hand by doing whatever they do best. The piano teacher is hosting a fundraiser concert of her and her beautiful students, the collections of which shall be dedicated solely towards helping underprivileged souls with COVID relief.If you are at home right now, not looking for oxygen, able to have nutritious and 3 filling meals a day then you are blessed and privileged. The current shortage of essential medical supplies like oxygen and medicines has put many lives at risk. This scarcity has also increased the costs of these medical essentials tremendously. Many deaths can be avoided with timely medical help. However, either the required help is not available or unaffordable at its exorbitant cost.The lockdown gave a serious blow to the bellies of countless individuals who survived on daily wages. After losing all sources to earn a living, they managed for a few days on their meager savings. But how long would that last? With barely any money to even put food on the table, medical care was a distant dream.Riddhima Rele a pianist and a piano teacher from Mumbai who has taken the initiative to utilize her art for helping out the ones affected by COVID. She’s organizing a concert where she’d be performing along with her students. The entire show shall be a virtual one keeping the lockdown restrictions in place and will be entirely dedicated towards COVID relief.The lockdown hasn’t been a great time for artists either, however, Riddhima has taken the step to utilize her art for saving lives. Your donations towards this fundraiser will not only save one life by getting them oxygen on time or provide a hungry person with a nutritious meal but also be a motivator for artists. No one has ever become poor by giving and this is the time when humans are in dire need of humanity.Any and all donations towards this cause will be highly appreciated and enable Riddhima and her students to provide help for as many people as possible. Even one share about this fundraiser by you on social media could be the difference between life and death for someone. For all donations above Rs 250, a link will be shared that will enable you to attend the concert. No one deserves to be refused help while dealing with something so deadly and only your donation can ensure that.",

  "story": "About the campaignIt is our plea to donors in India and the rest of the world to support people affected due to COVID surge in India, particularly in Bidar. Our campaign is to raise funds for the people of Bidar, a city of 200,000+ population in the Northern part of Karnataka in India. A large section of the population in Bidar have lost access to livelihood and social safety nets due to the extended lockdown period. This has resulted in an economic crisis alongside the second wave - leading to no wages, hunger and increased risk for those with non-COVID illnesses. Why we need your supportAlongside the support necessary for immediate needs such as oxygen generators and ventilators, it is essential to direct resources towards caring for those whose family members have been impacted by COVID, and those who are facing economic and health crises as a result of the current situation. While a lot of resources have been directed towards big cities, the second wave has had a massive impact on smaller cities and rural India, where the scale of the crisis is not being sufficiently addressed. This seemingly uncritical part of the current crisis, and its indirect impacts adds to the pressure on the already overstretched Public Health and social infrastructure in Bidar. It also increases the challenges faced by those caring for COVID-affected friends and family, and place their health at risk.As per the latest Government order only populations that are ready for their second dose of vaccination in the 45+ age group are eligible to receive vaccination. The procurement of vaccination is primarily being addressed by the local government agencies. A parallel effort is needed to vaccinate the eligible population through awareness and making it safe for people to come out for their second dose. What we are doingWe are providing essential relief-based support to those impacted by the pandemic and lockdown. We are focussed on supporting those directly and indirectly affected by this crisis - issues of non-COVID illnesses, hunger caused by lockdowns and loss of income, stress faced by caregivers, and lack of connectivity to essential medicines, healthcare and vaccines due to lockdowns and panic. What will you supportWe have identified five important areas of support that are not easily available through government aids or civic organisations in Bidar. Your contribution will be utilised to show care and solidarity through providing following support -Food distribution/Cooked meals: Sending cooked meals to people fighting &amp; suffering from COVID and their attenders; Free distribution of food to the homeless and locations where daily wage labourers are commonly found. Organise &amp; distribute cooked meals for daily wage labourers, roadside dwellers and abandoned people with disabilities. Reshine organisation has identified multiple locations in Bidar where the population in need can be found.Daily essentials &amp; food grains: Many families are unable to source daily essentials such as food and hygiene supplies. We have identified areas/groups/communities since the 1st lockdown last year. We have reached out to these communities this year too to collate their needs. These families belong to vulnerable communities like the Alemaris (nomadic), Waddar community, etc who are dependent on daily incomes. Additionally we are taking requests from other NGOs (7+) working on-ground in Bidar.Nutrition for HIV+ children: Nutrition and support for 250 HIV +ve Children in Bidar Taluka, at estimated costs of Rs. 2500 per child per month.Medicines: Help find &amp; deliver non-COVID prescription medicines for patients with chronic conditions and comorbidities. Currently the need for medicines is shared with the NGOs group.Awareness &amp; Transportation to Vaccinate eligible population: Organise awareness drives along with Gram Panchayat task forces, arrange free transportation for senior citizens facing emergencies, and mobilise people to enable them to reach Taluka hospitals, public health centres, and sub-centres for vaccination drives from their respective bastis and villages in Bidar taluka.Who we areWe are members of two NGOs based in Bidar - Reshine Organisation &amp; Team YUVAA. Volunteers from our networks have been extending support to people on-ground close to a decade in Bidar. Since the pandemic in 2020, we have joined with other NGOs and the district administration to organise relief packages, led COVID awareness initiatives &amp; testing campaigns, distributed masks, provided travel support to migrant workers, medical help and medicines to women, children &amp; elderly, and trained volunteers from across the district to support this work. We have also provided support to Asha workers and members at public health centres &amp; Bidar Institute of Medical Sciences (BRIMS). Donate and Share",

  "story": "The Grim SituationThe second wave of COVID-19 is raging across India, claiming a devastating toll of deaths and putting unprecedented strain on the country’s resources. In India’s cities, containment measures have managed to curb the spread of the virus, but alarmingly, it has now crossed the boundary of suburbs and small towns and is tearing through a fragile health infrastructure in rural areas. Grim reports are coming from the remotest corners of India, where disadvantaged people lack basic awarenessand have almost no access to testing and treatment facilities. People’s lives are at stake, not to speak of the crippling effect on their livelihoods.Our Mission &amp; Vision‘LokSakha’ (Friends of the people)was formed by a group of professionals and entrepreneurs with experience in medical, clinical, operational and grassroots-level work, with the urgent mission of fighting the spread of COVID-19 in rural areas and providing care and treatment to those affected. We envision a COVID-free rural India. To do so, we aim to:●Train, equip and enable frontline workers and villagers to fight the pandemic●Spread general awareness●Provide medical advice and guidelines and access to medicines, supplements, and basic medical equipment●Provide daily support to the COVID-19 positive families through distribution of masks, sanitizers, meals, groceries and essential items●Provide treatment support in terms of oxygen delivery and connection to the nearest healthcare facility●Support the government vaccination drive and help sanitize key local sitesOur ProgressWith 70+ dedicated volunteers working tirelessly, four project partners on board, and the support of senior doctors, pathologists and research scientists in advisory roles, LokSakha has started its work across multiple rural locations including Kurumboghosh (Birbhum), Bahin, Raiganj (North Dinajpur), and the Sunderbans (24 Parganas, South). LokSakha aims to scale up itsprojects and integrate these with government initiatives to ensure the existing healthcare infrastructure is not overburdened and lives are saved.Your Contribution to the CauseProviding COVID-care for a family of five members over 45 days costs us approximately USD 125 (INR 8,800).

  "story": "Who We Are?The Aadharwad Foundation is a Charitable Trust (NGO) actively working since past few years in drought affected region of Maharashtra, especially for deceased or needy farmer families and destitute children's, helping them with Farming Aid, Medical Aid, Rehabilitation Aid and Educational Aid. It intends to help farmers and their left behind families morally, financially or in any other way, not only to prevent them from ending their own lives but bring to normal as everyone of us. Visit our website https://aadharwadfoundation.org for more details.Are We Legal?Yes, Aadharwad Foundation is authentic organization and registered under Maharashtra Societies Registration Act 1860 with Registration number Maha-278/16 and also it has been certified as a Trust under Bombay Trust Act 1950 with Registration number as F-11668 (Jalna) issued by at Assistant Charity Commissioner Office, Jalna Maharashtra. This Trust is regularly audited by a Chartered Accountant and reports to Income Tax Office under PAN number AAFTA5929B. How is India's COVID 19 Situation?As per sources, India is recording over 3 lakh new Covid-19 cases every 24 hours. The rapid increase in new caes has taken India's total infection count over 1.66 crore. With thousands of fatalities each day, the death toll is now over 1.89 lakh. This rapid increase in cases has flooded the Hospitals and Primary Health Care centers with Covid positive patients, especially in rural area - this is where we are focused. What are we doing? Hard times don't create Heroes. It is during the hard times when the heroes within us is revealed. Since March 2020 the Aadharwad Foundation is more focused on COVID relief initiatives, planned independently as well as jointly with Government authorities.In March 2020 when this pandemic started, our volunteers did some brainstorming and planned a thoughtful roadmap to act in 3 specific fronts, [1] Strengthen Healthcare System[2] Support farmers [3] Relief for destitutes Provided Personal Safety and Medical accessories for Healthcare workers at 2 Rural Hospitals (owned by Government) and 4 Primary Health Care Center (PHC), 1 Covid Isolation Center within Partur and Mantha tehsils in Jalna district. We provided them with PPE Kits, N95 Masks, Surgical Masks, Sanitizers, Safety gloves, Bedsheets, Reusable masks for general staff etc. of worth more than 2.5 lakh rupees. This initiative was carried out under direct supervision of SDO (Deputy Collector) at Partur. Farmers are backbone of our country and we can not ignore them during such pandemic. During lock-down the small farmers were finding it very difficult to sell their fruits &amp; vegetables in to the market. To ease their pain, we purchased 113 Quintals of fruits directly from farmers, going at their farm and at a price higher than current market. This has directly benefited many farmers in Jalna district, and benefited many others indirectly because due to this 'smart move' all local dealers were forced to offer better competitive price to farmers in that region. We do agree that its difficult time for everyone one of us, but it is terrible for those that are daily wage workers and especially orphans and old age people families. In order to provide some relief to such families, we provided food and kitchen grocery kits to carefully identified families from villages and slum areas of Partur tehsil. Also, more than 40 Quintals of fruits (Watermelon, Orange) have been distributed at free of cost.Facing 2nd wave, assuming a 3rd wave coming, What now? Unfortunately this pandemic isn't over even after an year. And, rapid increase in covid cases the Government's medical facilities are about to collapse, especially in rural area. Therefore, we have started to look in to that and successfully setup our first COVID Specialty Medical Centers (CSMC) at Partur. We have set this up with all required infrastructure and has handed over to Rural Hospital Partur on 9th May 2021 in presence of Hon. Health Minister of Government of Maharashtra and Hon. District Collector of Jalna. This facility can accommodate and treat 20 mild or moderate patients (non ICU) at a time who would need 24X7 Oxygen supply. A team of 4 doctors and 8 nurses are managing this facility to provide medical treatment at complete free of cost. We have invested more than 7.5 lakhs until so far in this project and will continue to support in managing it going forward as well. The beauty of this medical facility is that, it will exist even after Covid pandemic and continue to serve needy people from surrounding 92 villages. next Step? Oxygen Bank.While managing this medical facility, we realized that hospital bed with Oxygen supply is crucial for critical patients but many people get admitted in early stage itself assuming that they might not find a bed when they need it or sometime they continue to occupy bed only for Oxygen support. To overcome this problem, now our aim is to create Oxygen Bank (mobile as well as Immobile), which will solve two purpose. Enable us to keep hospital beds available for critical patients and to provide emergency Oxygen support to needy at their residence with minimum risk. This facility will support the needy &amp; economically poor patients who don't have access or can not afford to buy or rent oxygen concentrators for post covid sustenance of saturation levels till they get to full normalcy.One Oxygen Concentrator (portable machine) would cost us around Rs. 50,000 at a minimum and we aim to establish this Oxygen Bank with at least 40 Oxygen Concentrators to start with, leading to a need of minimum 20 lakhs to hit the target. Once pandemic is over, all these portable Oxygen Concentrators can be kept in RH and PHCs for the benefit of handling any such emergency situations. At the same time, setting up 4 more CSMC at different location will enable us to treat more patients, leading to a need of minimum 30 lakhs. We urge your support to help us raise 50 lakhs for this noble cause.",

As a family, we are trying our best to support her.As you can imagine, the next few days putting the focus on fighting this head-on comes not only with intense emotional and physical challenges but also a financial challenge.

We were witnessing losing lives in front of our eyes for the past 12 months. When we inquired about the story of death, mostly boils down to three main reasons1.Affordability &amp; availability of ambulance, yes many private ambulances exploit the situation and charge abnormally. Government Ambulance availability is a big challenge and it is mostly NOT available for underprivileged and voiceless people2.Inability or lack of knowledge to find the availability in hospital through the internet or other means. When the usual attempt to nearby Hospital fails, most of the low-income group and underprivileged people really don't know the next step3.Making decisions on when to move to the Hospital from home, on which date of symptoms and on what symptoms are completely a dark area, most of the cases start after losing consciousness and thus they lose Golden hour too.We are attempting to place an Ambulance with oxygen support 24X7. The trust number will inquire about the situation of the patient in call, if necessary, bring in Doctors on a video conference to validate the criticality of the situation, then identify the bed availability through the Government website, Hospital numbers, and doctors who are members and volunteers in our trust. Pick up the patient at right time and admit to the right facility leaving the rest to the Hospital and experts to save.We tried helping families who lost the breadwinners and serious patients to get them back, we thought those are firefighting and short-lived solutions, but lifting a patient at right time and admitting in the right facility can be the more productive and meaningful solution and hence stated this initiative. Our trust members and volunteers contributed to the initiative and we are short of Rs.300000 to accomplish our goal.This reaching out to helping hands, so that we can save hundreds of lives with this solution in the coming days. We have enclosed our appeal and samples of our past activities reported in the reputed press publications as an introduction to our trust. Please support our initiative and help us reach the last mile of our goal.Donate and Share",

Last year they organised an extensive COVID relief program and provided support for more than 2lakh underprivileged people.This year with more than 4 lakh new cases, India's total caseload crosses 17 million. India has set a new global record for a rise in daily coronavirus cases, while deaths from COVID-19 also jumped to an all-time high. West Bengal logged the highest single day spike of 20846 new cases last week and it has not even hit its peak yet. Kolkata is witnessing a huge shortage of resources in treating corona virus cases. In these circumstances, the demand for Oxygen is increasing everyday and supply is very limited. KSCH had started an initiative to help provide Oxygen to the those who need it and are unable to afford it. They started with a goal of procuring 100 oxygen cylinders and so far with the support of donors, have been able to procure 47 cylinders.Each one of these cylinders costs anywhere from Rs.18000 - Rs.30000. There is additional cost for support equipment like flow meters, Oxygen masks, refillable oxygen cylinders, oxygen canisters etc. In the current situation, the prices for all these have increased because of a high demand.  Kolkata Society for Cultural Heritage has a proven track record of supporting rural Bengal and has a solid plan of action for COVID relief in the city and districts. Funds raised with this campaign will be used to procure 47-liter O2 cylinders and supporting equipment.KSCH has already created dedicated helplines (24-hr) to receive requests for O2, 24 volunteers have been allocated to receive orders and deliver cylinders. KSCH was able to procure 47 cylinders with the generosity of donors like you and has saved 1,114 lives so far. The goal is to procure a total of 100 cylinders to be able to save more lives.I am Vivek Gadicherla, a student of Grade 10 in Bangalore. I found out about KSCH through my Mom while she was speaking to the founder about their initiative to help people during this crisis. I wanted to do something to help them procure these Oxygen cylinders so, I decided to started this crowdfunding campaign to raise Rs.200000 towards their objective.A team of 100+ volunteers and employees are working hard to help KSCH meet their objective of saving lives. But they can’t do it without your help. Join me in helping these under privileged people breathe easy with your generosity.  Please Donate and Share to help me reach my goal quickly.",

  "story": "In 2020, the whole world witnessed the worst pandemic in many decades caused by coronavirus, the origin of which is still a mystery. Millions of people have succumbed to this lethal virus. Many countries have been successful in tackling it, but many others are still struggling to fight against this deadliest virus and India is one of them. The second wave of covid19 has hit like a Tsunami in India and has taken its toll. Thousands of people infected with covid19 are recorded daily and the hospitals are reeling under the shortage of beds and medical assistance especially the oxygen supply. So far 2,14,85,285 cases have been reported in India resulting in a surge in demand on the hospital infrastructure. The whole scenario is very gruesome.The hospitals are overwhelmed with thousands of dead bodies; whether it’s a graveyard or crematorium, there is a long queue of dead bodies everywhere. Sighs from every family are echoing in the streets and every neighborhood. Whosoever has not yet come under the grip of this deadly virus, is living in a constant fear. A total of 2.3 million casualties have been reported in India and the numbers are rising. Every state in the subcontinent is under the grips of the second wave and Dehradun, capital of Uttarakhand is one of them. With77,611 infected people reported, 1877 have deceased in Dehardun (as of 06/05/2021). The story of Dehradun is no different from the rest of India and there are not many hospitals around with beds availability and oxygen supply. People have to travel a long distance to get treatment and sometimes the patient don’t even make it to the hospital.The situation is so grim that everyone is living under a constant fear of whether they will survive this second wave. There are so many sad stories of people who have lost their battle against corona virus despite following the guidelines strictly and taking all precautions. Mr. Rajesh Saini is one of them. Mr. Saini was in his early 40s and till the time he was alive, he was under constant fear and was worried about his family. He was concerned that if something happens to him who will look after his wife, two daughters (15- and 8-year-old) and an ailing mother who are all dependent on him. He was the only breadwinner in the family.He did all he could to stay safe by following covid guidelines strictly and survived the first wave of covid19 in India, but he could not protect himself from getting under the grips of second wave and within a few minutes everything changed for his family. Even on his death bed, he did not think about himself instead, he called his elder brother and pleaded in front of him to look after his daughters. The only reason why he lost this battle is because he did not get a bed in hospital in the vicinity and his family had to take him to another hospital, which was miles away from his home. By the time he reached hospital, he succumbed to covid19. This news has hit his family hard, and they still cannot believe that the only bread winner in their family is no more. To bring the situation under control, the State Governments have announced lockdown, which has affected the daily wage earners badly, making it difficult for them to arrange food for their family. The social workers and the local government in my area are working hard to help people by providing meals to the poor families and to those whose entire family is infected and there is no one in the family to cook food. The social workers are going from door to door of the sick families and assisting them with the medical assistance (medicines, oximeter) and providing other essentials. They are renovating a local hospital and making rooms for 150 beds for covid patients and getting oxygen supply so that the patients do not have to travel a long distance in emergency, but this requires a great amount of funds and resources.Being unemployed for more than a year, I can’t do much by myself, but I can’t be a mute spectator too and watch people around me suffer. I wasn’t sure how I can help my community until my friends and colleagues in the UK and elsewhere started messaging me to check on me after they gathered how bad the situation in India is and they asked me if there is anything they can do to help me. It is with this inspiration that I decided to start this fundraiser and do what I can to help my community. My motive behind this fundraiser is to arrange oxygen cylinders and other medical supply in the new covid centre in the vicinity. Since, we are under lockdown, it is difficult for daily wage earners to arrange food and other necessities for themselves. We are working with the social workers and the activists who are working 24*7 to provide food and basic medical assistance to the poor people. We will also support a local hospital to convert it into covid centre so that the people in critical condition don’t have to travel a long distance and can get immediate help. Depending on the funds we raise, we might as well get a ventilator for the covid centre along with the oxygen cylinders. I kindly request you all to please help us in this fight against this crisis by donating generously. Your contribution can help save someone’s life and feed a family. We will be grateful to you for all your help.",

  "story": "I'm Leelavathi and I'm raising funds for my husband Shankar Narayanan’s treatment, who is 47 years old. He is suffering from Black fungus post suffering from covid-19 prior to this. For his condition, he has recently undergone surgery and needs to continue to be in ventilator and oxygen support under CCU observation. Currently seeking treatment from Apollo hospital, Greams road, Chennai. My Husband Shankar Narayanan was tested Covid Positive and was admitted to the hospital for treatment. My husband&amp;#39;s condition progressively deteriorated over time. He was experiencing acute dyspnea, and after that, he developed black fungus-like enlarged eyes. We rushed him to Apollo hospital. Doctors stated that black fungus had affected his right eye and upper jaw. For which he underwent extensive surgery right away. Doctors removed his diseased right eye and upper jaw teeth to prevent the infection from spreading further. With critical care management, he is on oxygen and ventilator support.We have spent more than Rs.17 lakhs so far but he needs few more weeks of hospitalization for which treatment will be costing an additional Rs.10 lakhs. Arranging that huge amount is nearly impossible for us. The upcoming week is very crucial for my husband and We are not ready to lose him. We have two daughters and managing livelihood is difficult without him. Adding on to it this health care expense has left us exhausted financially. His two daughters are eagerly waiting for the day their father will come back home to them and I wish this from my bottom of the heart that the day comes soon enough. I will do everything in my capacity to help him revive, but this comes with a huge financial burden and stress. I, as his spouse kindly request you to please contribute to my husband’s treatment and give a chance for his survival. He has an excellent chance of recovery after the completion of treatment. Any contribution will be of immense help. We are looking for help to come out of this health crisis. I request you to share this fundraising campaign with all your friends and family members. Any small contribution could help us battle this condition.",

  "story": "The second wave of COVID 19 unleashed a shockwave of chaos throughout the country. At this point, we all know someone who lost their life to COVID 19 and someone who is fighting the battle. Deaths spiraling out of control, long queues outside the hospital, glowing crematoriums, and overwhelmed medical staff have shown that at such trying times it is only community help that can get us through this. Covi10 is a joint initiative by 4 humanitarian organizations that have understood the needs of society during these testing times and are directly addressing them.The prevailing pandemic has affected every individual of the society in a direct or indirect way and has caused not just economic but also social destruction. The difficulties that are being faced by society today have created the need to have a dedicated relief task force that can provide curated and relevant help to individuals dealing with COVID. We have been able to segregate the 10 areas of dire need currently in the given categories.1. Financial &amp; Livelihood insecurity2. Access to food, medication &amp; essentials3. Access to hospital, doctors &amp; donors4. Children &amp; adolescents’ needs5. Old people’s needs6. Criminal impacts7. Social events and associations8. Healthcare workforce needs9. Life practices &amp; WFH adoption10. Emerging mental &amp; behavioral constructCovi10’s approach in dealing with these needs involves 3 key support areas - Base Kitchen, Volunteers, and MedicollectWe intend to provide 1000 meals daily for the next 60 days to the COVID-affected individuals who need the required nutrition and care for recovery. With the help of households who are eager to join the COVI10 initiative, our task force will be able to help them with linkages and ensure the needed help reaches the individual. Many households have already been identified in the areas of Vashi, Kolhapur, and Gurgaon who’d be happy to join in this causeOur target is to have 60 people in the Covi10 task force by the end of July ’21 so that we can offer 10 NEEDS-based services and support across 3 working shifts. Our core team is dedicatedly invested to get the right people on board who have the intent and understand the commitment of this endeavor. Considering the bearing this type of work will have on our volunteers, payouts are but a small token of our gratitude.Finally, we also intend to deliver 1500 medicine boxes/units per city monthly for the next 3 months. By involving emerging NGOs dedicated to the relief work, we will be collecting and procuring remaining medicines from recovered &amp; Covid -ve households and redistributing them in villages and other rural areas across Delhi, Mumbai &amp; Bangalore.This step has been taken with the motive to be of aid to the individuals and sections of the society that are having a tough time dealing with the crisis without any apparent solution. It is only by lending each other a hand, can we beat this pandemic and get through it. Hence we request you to donate any amount comfortable to this cause so that we can ease the suffering of at least one person. Sharing this cause with your network on social media will be a huge help as well. So please contribute in whatever way you can as we’re all in this together.",

Over 8.6% of India's population are tribals and are characterized by economic backwardness, lack of medical facilities, and lack of health insurance.The COVID 19 pandemic has not only hit the livelihood of these tribal communities but it has exposed them to the fatalities of this novel virus. The lack of access to healthcare and limited finances is proving to be a matter of life and death for these communities.The definite way to protect these communities is by ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccination and health insurance. Unfortunately, these communities have limited access to smartphones, internet connectivity, and basic identity documents to register for the vaccination. At Haqdarshak we are proposing to support these communities with :COVID - 19 vaccination registrationAccess to government health insuranceAccess to relevant identity documents to access the above facilitiesYour contribution of Rs.200 per citizen will ensure these communities have access to vaccination and health insurance to sustain through the pandemic.Our story :Haqdarshak is a social enterprise striving to ensure citizens across India have access to government entitlements.

We are bringing innovative solutions driven by frontline health workers to provide home based remote monitoring solutions for COVID positive cases and effective screening mechanism to reduce the population spread in regions with high case overload. We will ensure to reach out to every community at the last mile who are left behind in this crisis.Mission:Our aim is to distribute 500,000 olfactory screening kits and 2,500 remote monitoring kits in rural and semi-urban regions in Nagaland, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Meghalaya and Rajasthan in India.The initiatives your money will support:Remote Health Monitoring Support:Expanding access to COVID-19 positive patients through remote monitoring services. The coordinated medical support, delivered through a hub-and-spoke model, provides patients with continuous care. We have seen patients recover fast and have a lower rate of hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) in critical cases. This has reduced the need for a hospital bed and oxygen support. This tracking mechanism also ensures that family members receive early alerts. The initiative is supported by:·Telemedicine app·Team of Doctors·Trained Frontline Health Workers &amp; Paramedics·Dieticians, and Psychology ConsultationOlfactory Screening Kits: Loss of Sense of Smell is an early sign of COVID-19. 68 percent of people have reported loss of smell or olfactory impairment in active COVID cases.RT-PCR tests are usually done either too early or too late in the infection cycle leading to false-negative results. iKure is introducing scratch &amp; sniff U-Smell-It-Olfactory test that alerts you for an RT-PCR test, isolate, and identify symptomatic patients. The test can be carried out up to 50, 000 tests per day in remote regions by frontline health workers that can effectively track and monitor population spread. It requires less than 5 minutes using select Indian effervescence to detect early loss of smell.

  "story": "I am completing 25 today and what better than having all of you come together for a special cause to support 95 lives in need! So, here we go…...Aa Chalke Tujhye, Main Leke Chalun,Ek Aise Gagan Ke Tale,Jahan Gam Bhi Na Ho, Aasu Bhi Na Ho,Bas Pyaar Hi Pyaar Pale…As I hum the tune of this beautiful song by Kishor Da, my heart longs to walk my country and its people to a pandemic-free world, where the cries and pain of so many around us will disappear, and all that will surround us is happiness and good health.That’s when I heard a voice from within that said, “Nisha, you need to do something.”It all began with a deep sense of gratitude and a pinch of pricking guilt when I saw and read about innumerable people in need, who’re not half as lucky and fortunate as I am. I am blessed to have a little more than what they do. Doesn’t that call for some responsibility to take care of them to whatever extent I can? It does. And here I am, on my 25th birthday, inviting EACH ONE OF YOU to join hands with me to help underprivileged people from Bangalore survive and sustain the pandemic crisis.Sending HELP, Spreading HOPE, Sharing HAPPINESSWith Sree Sai Krupa Charitable Trust - Home for Old Age, Orphans &amp; DestituteI came across this amazing team from Bangalore that’s running Sree Sai Krupa Charitable Trust, a non-profit, non-political and secular organisation. Founded in 2007 by Mr. Shivarudra, and ably supported by his wife Shashi, the organisation today houses 95 people from different age groups and backgrounds, who have nowhere else to go to. This includes orphans, children with single parents &amp; children who are socially misled, old citizens, and even the destitute women. I was touched and moved by the kind of work that the couple has been doing selflessly in all these years.Why does this home need you now more than ever?The pandemic has hit each one of us in ways more than one. Amidst all the challenges, the couple continues to push its own boundaries for the 95 souls dependent on them. Sree Sai Krupa Charitable Trust is a home for all those who don’t have one.Meet 62-year-old Sharadamma who is a resident of the Ashram &amp; this is what she has to say to all of us - \"It’s been 7 years since my son left me here. From then onwards, these people are my family.. They take care of me well with love and care.. I want to stay here forever.\"However, Mr. Shivarudra has a different story to share - “The monthly operational expenses sum up to Rs. 5 lakh. Today, we have 52 children in our Ashram and they are like our own. They call us Amma and Appa. We feel so elated nurturing them, seeing them grow here, right in front of our eyes. I am hopeful of continuing this work to the best of what I can, for the sake of these children, women and elderly who are like family to us. But there is only little that I can do alone. We have 10 COVID patients in the Ashram, we have elderly whose medical expenses are to be taken care of, and we have children whose educational expenses are rising too. To top it all, it’s been 4 months we haven’t been able to pay the rent.”Rs. 5 lakhs is huge. Not when 1000 of us contribute Rs. 500 each. It’s that simple!I’m reaching a milestone in my life, completing 25 this year. And I want to have a blast on my birthday. This is my earnest appeal to each of my loved ones out there. We can really make this happen together. I urge you - on my birthday, if you intend to send in a gift, a wish, or bless me from wherever you are, translate all your love for me into a donation for my fundraiser. Small or big, every gesture counts. Please come forward to support Shivarudraji, and his wife in their efforts to run their organisation without a pause. Let your kindness spread faster than the virus that has challenged all of us. This fundraiser has been started to raise enough funds for members at Sree Sai Krupa Charitable Trust to sustain for about a month.Here’s how you can help &amp; make my birthday all the more special:All it takes is a small sacrifice and a big heart to feel for those in pain. Can we all give up the amount that we usually spend on a pizza, on online shopping, on renewing our OTT subscription to help 95 members in need of basic essentials to survive like food, medicines, education &amp; more? I am donating and doing my bit. Please support me in this initiative.Let us all do our bit to make sure that, despite a global pandemic, this institution can continue doing the good work that they do for the underprivileged.﻿Please donate and share this message to all those who you think can help. I hope that your love and blessings for me on my birthday will help to bring a positive impact for many of these people.Thank you and loads of love,Nisha",

It relays the data over the cloud making it available anywhere and replaces the manual spot checks with continuous monitoring. The data is analyzed by our AI-powered triaging system to alert the clinicians and nurses to take timely actions.Implemented in over 170 hospitals and 4000+ beds across India, it is proven to reduce nurse's and duty doctor's load by 30% and improving patient outcomes by reducing patient mortality by 5%.Just imagine what would have been the impact if every public hospital bed was step-down ICU.Under the initiative, we take end-to-end ownership of implementing the devices, training the nurses and doctors, and ensuring smooth functioning in 2000 public hospital beds across 30 hospitals across 8 districts in India.

  "story": "My name is Dr. Arjun Sachidanand and I am raising funds for an innovative plan to assist the vulnerable Geriatric population, people with one or more co-morbid conditions and the underprivileged rural population during these difficult times of the Covid-19 Pandemic in the form of “Sudhanand Arogya Vahini - SAV” through Dr. M. D. Sachidananda Murthy Memorial Educational Trust in association with SAS Poorna Arogya Health Care Program and Dr. M. D. Sachidananda Murthy Memorial Hospitals.We have come up with an idea for a vehicle -“Sudhanand Arogya Vahini - SAV”, which essentially is a Lab on Wheels that could go door-to-door and conduct various laboratory tests pertaining to patients' existing conditions as well as provide a means of getting them in touch via Telemedicine with a doctor who could give them sound medical advice, thereby preventing them from having to visit hospitals and coming in contact with potential sources of infection. This method also serves a dual purpose. This will greatly lessen the burden on hospitals and labs. It will also be used to collect data regarding age, sex, travel history, existing symptoms and pre-existing co-morbid conditions. So, there is a possibility of detecting previously undiagnosed diseases as well.4 SAVs will be launched initially in 3 districts of Karnataka, namely Mysore, Kodagu &amp; Chamarajanagar, where Dr. M. D. Sachidananda Murthy Memorial Hospitals are situated.SAVThey will each be equipped with a Haematology Analyzer, Biochemical Analyzer, ECG Machine, Sphygmomanometer and Pulse Oximeter. They will consist of a sink, soap dispenser, cupboards, medicine cabinets, waste bins, chairs along with having power and water supply. One of the main components of these vehicles is a “Tele-Communication Kiosk”, which consists of a computer that will form a doctor-patient interface and a printer which will be used to deliver reports of laboratory tests to the patients. Lab reports will also be delivered to patients’ registered mobile numbers in view of maintaining confidentiality and conserve paper.Lab Investigations that will be performed by SAV:These are an array of investigations that can be done at the SAV at subsidized costs. Reports of lab investigations shall be given to the patient for future use.1.Complete Blood Count2. Blood Sugar Analysis - FBS/PPBS/RBS/HbA1c3. Renal Function Tests - Blood Urea/Serum Creatinine/Serum Uric Acid4. Liver Function Tests5.Lipid Profile6. Thyroid Function Tests7. Urine dipstick tests8. ECG9. Blood Grouping10. Serum Calcium11. Serum Ferritin12. D-Dimer13. LDH14. Various Card TestsImpact of SAV on the socio-economic problems of rural sector:The socio-economic burden ofCOVID-19 is more recognized in the rural sector. For every visit an individual has to make to the hospital he/she has to bear the travel expenses, lab test costs and also the consultation fees of the doctor. SAV will definitely make a significant difference in this regard as the diagnosis will be at the door step and consultation will be done online free of cost. Also, through SAV the laboratory investigations are done at a subsidized cost which would otherwise cost the patient a considerable sum. This will help the patients monetarily in a substantial way.Sustainability:We intend to make SAV a self - sustainable model. The remuneration collected from the laboratory investigations (which are subsidized) will be utilized to buy lab reagents and other consumables. It will also provide for the salaries of support staff of SAV.Scalability:SAV will begin as a pilot project with 4 units covering 3 districts of Mysore, Chamarajanagar and Kodagu. It will scale to cover the 114 network hospitals registered under SAS Poorna Arogya Program situated in Karnataka and the North-Eastern states of Assam, Mizoram and Meghalaya in a phased manner requiring a duplication of 114 more such Lab in a Van (Sudhanand Arogya Vahini - SAV) units.Note: Impact Guru and all of its operations are strictly compliant with the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 and the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Rules, 2011 along with all amendments, circulars, notifications and/or orders in relation thereto (collectively, \"FCRA\").

As many people who were working in the informal sector lost their jobs, the survival of them and their families has been put at risk. A Telangana based NGO Sun Charitable Trust is one of the helping hands that are serving the community for COVID relief. They need your help to continue with their noble work. Will you lend them a hand?Ever since the second wave’s shockwave hit the country, our lives have been turned upside down. However, the worst brunt has been faced by the ones who belong to a low socio-economic background. A lot of daily wagers lost their jobs more than a year ago when the lockdown started and to date have run dry on their savings. During such a dire situation when even 2 meals a day is a luxury, affording health care has become a distant dream.Sun Charitable trust has been helping out these underserved people with food free of cost. They have also been distributing masks, sanitisers to many workers who are out in public space. Their effort here is to create momentum through online contributions and keep the entire process contact-free.Since funds are limited, they now seek help from humanitarians like you to aid their cause. The number of people who are in need is also increasing at a magnificent rate. Inspite of doing everything possible, they are unable to attend to many requests for help.Every day they get several requests for some underprivileged soul who needs food and are trying to ensure that no one is refused help during such trying times. Every tiny donation will be a huge help in saving at least one life. Even sharing this story among your friends and family on social media will be an immense help. Please donate as this a hard time for many out there and pray that we shall be able to beat COVID 19 soon and together. Donate and Share",

Every day, more than hundred lives are being lost and thousands of others are fighting for their lives either at hospitals or under home isolation. The people living in these communities of North 24 Parganas are daily wage earners, migrant labourers (returned from their workplace) and survivors of human trafficking. The families have been compelled to stay back at home amid the lockdown declared in the entire state and this has resulted in loss of livelihood for several families. The families are struggling to arrange for their daily needs to survive and with no source of income at this point of time, it has become difficult for them to purchase required items. The government is providing rice and atta as part of dry ration support but that are not enough to survive and at the same time the families also require to procure other necessities like grocery items, vegetables etc. The children in the are also not fed properly due to lack of supply of milk and other cereals. This poorest of the poor families suffer the most as they do not have their own lands or pond to cultivate and sell them in the market. It has become significantly important at this time to stand by these families and support them overcome the situation. In continuation with the COVID-19 2nd Wave, the people in the coastal West Bengal have faced with another challenge of 'YAAS' cyclone. The cyclone has further affected the lives of common people in the intervention areas of PAT Network NGOs .

At the same time the families affected by 'YAAS' cyclone would also be provided with similar support for them them to survive and restore with normal life. The support would be extended for two months consecutively so that these families can survive under this difficult circumstance. These families also include families of migrant labourers and families affected by COVID-19 second wave. Need based support would be extended to the families. PAT Network NGOs would also distribute SAFETY kits including PPE to the most 150 vulnerable survivors and 40 frontline Social Workers so that they can provide services to community.Where does your support go?The support would be distributed to selected 300 poorest of the poor families through the 8 partner organisations and the support would include: cooking oil, soya chunk, puffed rice, biscuits, baby food, sugar, salt, spices etc. Apart from these the families would also be provided with sanitization kit including hand sanitizer, masks and soaps. You can be a part of this initiative and stand beside these families with your generous support.

RBSE is one of the 170+ clubs in Rotary International District 3190. Amongst other things, RBSE undertakes to serve the community in the focus areas of Health, Education, Water and Sanitation, Global Peace, Disease Prevention, Relief during Calamities and Environment Protection.Now that the 1st wave of COVID-19 is over and the 2nd wave is on the decline, it isNOTthe time to relax or become complacent. In fact, this is the time toPREPAREfor the imminent 3rd wave predicted by most experts in the field.It is also reported that the 3rd wave is likely to affect children, as they would primarily not have been vaccinated.The most vulnerable of the lot would be the undernourished children.They need to be protected first.While vaccines for children are being developed, tested and will take time to be introduced, is there anything that we can do? YES we can.We can providenaturalimmunity boosters to such children and help them also to strengthen their own immune systems and fight the dreaded virus. THIS PROJECT IS A STEP IN THE DIRECTION OF PROACTIVELY BOOSTING AND STRENGTHENING the immunity of undernourished children.We will providenaturalimmunity boosters to undernourishedchildren under this programme. These carry no side effects. This immunity booster is calledMulmina®.The immunity boosters (MULMINA) are a formulation by Jagdale Industries Private Limited.Mulmina®is the world’s first aseptic Tetra Pak based, natural immune booster with powerful antioxidants, micronutrients and macronutrients. Mulmina®helps overcome common clinical ailments related to low immunity, oxidative stress and mental stress. Mulmina®is a tasty refreshing blend of Immune Nutrients like fruits, herbs with essential vitamins and minerals. Hence, Mulmina®due to its technology, product virtues and patient-centric benefits, brings an innovation in nutritional supplementation and makes it as themost preferred brand for boosting immunity.Every individual requires adequate levels of antioxidant defences in order to avoid the harmful effect of an excessive production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and to prevent damage to the immune cells. Based on the evidence so far, USDA suggests that daily intake of antioxidants must be between 3,000 and 5,000 Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) units to have a significant impact on plasma and tissue antioxidant capacity to overcome free radical menace. Mulmina®with its variants offers 5668 and 5400 ORAC units per 200ml pack.Jagdale Industries Private Limited , being manufacturersof these immunity boosters have agreed to supply at highly subsidised rates for this cause to RBSE.It just costs Rs.500 per child to provide this immunity booster dose for a period of 2 weeks.We propose to provide immunity boosters to UNDERNOURISHED CHILDREN. For this purpose, we would take support from the network of Public Health Centres (PHCs) in Bangalore and elsewhere for distribution. You might be aware that administering Pulse Polio to children is one of the biggest tasks Rotary Clubs have been undertaking worldwide. We take support of the network of PHCs in vaccinating about 6.4million children in Bangalore annually. We will take active support of Rotary clubs in District 3190 covering mainly Karnataka for this purpose.We at RBSE are passionate about this cause and believe that this project should be undertaken immediately and on a large scale.This would necessarily involve huge funding and involvement of the public at large. It just costs Rs.500 per child to provide this immunity booster dose for a period of 2 weeks.Our NGO, Rotary Bangalore South East is based out of Bengaluru and we have been committed to impacting and improving lives for 21 years now.To take our objective a step further, we have begun a crowdfunding campaign to raise INR 20 lakhs for COVID Relief. These are being used to further fund one of these projects;-1. Distribution of Masks, PPE kits and Groceries to the right beneficiaries.2.

  "story": "We are Abishaikh Gender and Development Association (AGADA), a nationally registered non-profit organization based in Coimbatore, India. Our organization was founded in January 2020. We emerged out of a pursuit to elevate and help communities by tending to their needs for the well-being of our society and the planet. Our vision is to build a just society above race, religion, caste, age, and sex.We've been working towards providing essentials to the underprivileged people of Coimbatore and Nilgiris districts in India that will potentially benefit about 424,000 people. Due to the nationwide lockdown, we have been actively carrying out our services since August 2020. During this short period, we have donated food, clothes, face masks, and grocery items to orphanages, care homes, and rural areas benefitting a total of about 20,000 people.To take our objective a step further, we have begun a crowdfunding campaign to raise Rs. 200,000 for the COVID Relief. COVID-19 cases in Coimbatore and Nilgiris have shot up, with over 12,592 active cases at present. Due to the rapid increase in cases, public hospitals and care centers have been running short of medical supplies like oxygen concentrators and ventilators. Hence, the fatality rate has increased drastically by 80% since the month of April. While private hospitals are privileged enough to source medical supplies easily by charging patients, public hospitals have suffered in providing proper treatment due to the lack of oxygen cylinders and necessary medical supplies.AGADA believes it is our duty to do our part in helping these hospitals with oxygen concentrators and the necessary medical supplies. With your help and support, we can save thousands of lives in our fight against COVID-19 at this great hour of need. With the funds raised for this cause, we're planning on sourcing oxygen concentrators and ventilators and donating them directly to public hospitals in Coimbatore and the Nilgiris.A team of 10 is working hard to help us meet our objective of transforming lives. But we can’t do that without you. Join us in helping millions with your generosity.  Donate and Share",

This unique hospital will have novel ways of providing complete care facilities &amp; solace to the patients and their attendants as well. Without any cash counter, it will keep track of them &amp; their families’ health even after being discharged. In Deoghar area, about 40% people are BPL families &amp; 30% people are the tribal. They will feel like at home here, without any monetary worries.The concept comes from the great spiritual seer Sri Sri Thakur Anukulchandra (1888-1969) who gave visionary insights into the bio-physical dynamics of human beings. . Such a novel health care will put Jharkhand on the map of advanced medical research. The details of the project are attached herewith for your kind perusal. The project is led by Rev. Dr. P. R. Chakraborty, a plastic surgeon of high repute. Dr Chakraborty lent his free service for the last 50yrs and is still doing so. Repair of the thyroglossal duct-neck and reconstruction of the sternomastoidmuscle; Excision Of the tuberculoma-rectum and repairingof the rectal muscles; Removal of 22kg of ovarian tumor from abdomen; Replacement of the right stricturedfallopian tube by appendix. These are the few of the countless innovative surgeries I can recollect at present,all of which he did without charging his fees,in the heart of that tribal area. Now that he is an octogenarianand wants to fulfill his lifelong dream of a fully charitable hospital according to his father's wish. Deoghar does not even have a proper ICU in its 250km radius. Under your able leadership, this hospital will surely become a jewel in the crown of the achievements of the Government of Jharkhand. To achieve this goal, we need your full support along with a video clipping wishing this project a success anda support letter for our brochure. We look forward to your support and help to materialise this endeavour towards serving the suffering multitudes.May the Supreme Lord bless you with all success, peace &amp; good health in life.Thanking You, Donate and Share",

He is survived by his wife and a 4 y/o daughter along with a dependent parent.Sudhir was working as an office security and reception team member with us for more than five years. Sudhir was a very hardworking, honest and dedicated, always smiling. He often went above and beyond his professional reach to help others. We will all miss his welcoming smile while entering the office premises. He was the only wage-earner in his family.

Words seem too small to express the sadness we feel about my wife's death. I couldn't believe that she left us all.She has left behind a grieving family.I work with a financing company and I could hardly make it up to the end of themonthwith my salary. We both are blessed with two beautiful kids, a 2-year-old girl, and a 4 months old boy. Life was going as fit as a fiddle.She was handling the whole family including my old parents who needed care for their treatments and medication.Everything was going well until the day she went to get the vaccination for my son. She started showing the symptoms of Covid. From then she was not able to eat and was continuously vomiting whatever she takes in. She couldn't even feed our babies.I didn't know it would turn our life into a grave. She was tested Covid positive withpneumonia and lung damage on May 4th. She left me, my kids, and the whole family in the late hours of May 18th, 2021. Now my job is also at stake and I have the complete responsibilityof my whole family. My kids need attention and every timethey ask for their mother, it is hard for me to tell them and to accept the fact that she is no longer with us.If you knew Sridevi, you would know that she was a bold, hardworking, and ambitious personality. For the kind of person Sridevi was, she also had many dreams for our two kids and family. We are here to seek your support to raise a fund that will reduce our family’s financial burden, our kids' education andcover the medical expenses of our aged parents. Your contribution of any magnitude will be a great help to the family.While no measure of money could amount to what she means for us, this fundraiser is an endeavor to cherish her memory and ease the financial burdens of our family.Every donation counts! \"﻿",

  "story": "The raging second wave of the COVID 19 pandemic has held India in its grip. As a desperate measure to contain the virus, a strict lockdown has been announced in multiple states. The end of this catastrophe is nowhere on the horizon and the lack of various resources is only growing. While many are struggling to arrange healthcare resources, countless others have lost their jobs and are dying of hunger. Virender Sehwag Foundation is lending a helping hand to many underserved souls who have no one to call their own during such trying times.The entire informal sector has taken the worst brunt of this lockdown. By earning their living one day at a time, they were able to put two meals a day in their families’ bellies. While the lockdown was necessary, it put a sudden halt to the earnings of these underprivileged souls. Their meager savings were used up and they have no one to turn to at this stage.Virender Sehwag Foundation’s team has been feeding more than 51000 families in the Delhi NCR area with fresh home-cooked meals. The entire team of volunteers has been visiting underprivileged localities and working on the field during these dangerous times to provide them with food. India has been gasping for oxygen for weeks now. Due to the depleting numbers of oxygen concentrators and cylinders, the number of deaths is just spiraling out of control. With the cremation grounds glowing constantly with the ever-increasing number of dead bodies, many are left in such a state that they are unable to afford even the cremation of their loved ones. Virender Sehwag Foundation wishes to provide oxygen concentrators for those who are in dire need and are unable to afford the exorbitant costs as well as lend a helping hand to them to perform the last rites of their loved ones.After helping these people out for many days, the funds are depleting, and procuring even the raw materials for cooking these meals is getting more and more difficult. In order to help out more and more people, we request you to help out by donating whatever you can to help these underprivileged individuals. Your contribution, no matter how big or small can help at least one person not go to bed hungry tonight. We can’t help millions, but we can definitely help one and get through this pandemic, together!Note :Impact Guru and all of its operations are strictly compliant with the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 and the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Rules, 2011 along with all amendments, circulars, notifications and/or orders in relation thereto (collectively, \"FCRA\").

  "story": "Integrated Society for Humanity Awareness and Nobility (ISHAN) is based out of Delhi and we are committed to impacting and improving lives for 4 years now. In 2020 when the government announced a complete lockdown in Delhi due to COVID. There was chaos everywhere. Work from home was assigned to people who were working in private and govt. firms. But work from home is not an option for the daily wage workers, neither is social distancing and self-isolation. Many workers such as Construction Workers and Street Vendors work at informal sites– by the road, at construction sites, at dump sites, and live hand to mouth. No work for them means no food at the end of the day. So we came forward and distributed dry ration kits and sanitary kits to up to 2500 families. Now in 2021 the second wave of COVID is much more worse than last year. Our country is facing acute crisis. The people are unable to even get a bed in hospital. This is the time that we all came together in this time of crisis and support each other. To take our objective a step further, we have decided that we will distribute cooked meals to the people who are affected by Covid-19 and are in home isolation. So we have begun a crowdfunding campaign to raise Rs.2,00,000 for the Food Distribution. Our team and volunteers are working hard to help us meet our objective of transforming lives. But we can’t do that without you. Join us in helping millions with your generosity. Even a small contribution of Rs.100 from you can provide a meal for a person.  Donate and Share",

The rapid peak in infection rate has brought the health infrastructure to its knees. With the lack of enough safety kits, life- saving medicines and medical care access, the situation of the marginalised and poor people of Nepal has worsened.GOAL 1: Supporting marginalised infected populations with COVID-19 relief kitsPeople from Tharu community of Nepal, the historically disadvantaged group of bonded labourers and other community members, are facing grave consequences due to lack of access to preventive measures, adequate medical care and income instability.As most people from the Tharu community and others in Nepal belong to the poorer sections of society and live in remote villages with limited medical resources, accessing a basic medicines and medical facilities has become even more difficult in these time of surged demand. Therefore we are making efforts to provide medical care access to such people through visits by a team of doctors and nurses to villages and communities and distribute safety and relief kits to the needy.Our aim is to fundraise NPR 10,850,000 / USD $94,347.83 in provision of 5,000 COVID-19 relief kits to the infected patients.

  "story": "Shambhu, a field technician lost his primary source of income because of lockdown.He did not even have money to buy basic medicines for his family. He is constantly looking for opportunities where he can leverage their skills and earn rather than a one-time donation. When he heard about Oxygen Concentrators, he knew that he cannot buy an oxygen concentrator but he can definitely fix one.In a matter of few days, our country will have lacs of OCs but no technical infrastructure to maintain thesemachines since 90% of them are non-branded and without any manufacturer’s support. This complex machinery, which is vital for survival for affected patients, will soon become a liability if not taken care of properly. How? Well, our research shows that 7% of machines are box-dead which means 7 out of every 100 machines don’t even turn on when taken out of the box. Another good percentage of machines break down or requiremaintenance services in the next few weeks to months of usage. If these complicated machines are not maintained properly, they would lead to unplanned downtime which ultimately will be very critical for patients. Oxi care realizes this and now is on a mission to provide jobs to 1000+ jobless technicians like Shambhu who lost their jobs during the pandemic. A Service Technician is the most hard-working person in the field. He is the one who brings our expensive gadgets back to life and yet he is the one who is most unnoticed and most underpaid. We are providing every technician with free Training to repair Oxygen Concentrators and also assigning him calls to actually repair defective concentrators. We are then paying them for every call so that by the end of the day they have enough money to support their families.These trained oxicare warriors will make these concentrators work, thereby saving millions of lives and also millions of dollars for India. We are making them ready for the current and future crisis so that they can save lives by offering these critical maintenance services and become part of India's healthcare infrastructure.To support the mission, Oxicare needs funds to provide FREE TRAINING, buy spares, buy equipment for servicing and also pay thousands of jobless service engineers who will act as a backbone in providing critical maintenance services to India. Help us and support this mission to save lives.",

In Spite of the healthcare system working to its maximum capacity, a huge number of people are not able to receive timely medical help. During such times, small initiatives from the community for helping people have come to the rescue. RCC Platinum Trust Chennai is currently on a mission to start its own COVID care center at Dadawadi for 150+ beds along with oxygen concentrator support.﻿﻿RCC Platinum Trust Chennai is a 16-year-old non-profit organization that has been in service to the Chennai community and public. Over the years they have undertaken many philanthropic initiatives that would benefit society at large and play a small role in making the world a better place.Currently, with the second wave of the pandemic, countless individuals are unable to receive timely medical help either due to the exorbitant costs or unavailability of resources. RCC Platinum Trust is creating its own COVID care center at Dadawadi Jain temple in Chennai. The area of more than 10,000 square feet will easily accommodate 150+ beds along with oxygen support as well as a team of doctors and nursing staff that will be available 24*7. The center will be able to provide all-day monitoring, nutritious vegetarian food, medicines along with yoga and positivity sessions that will help the patients stay strong while recovering.The cost for setting up this center is too high for a non-profit organization and they need help from generous souls to lend a hand with this initiative. This center will be able to give some aid to many who are suffering from this deadly virus and help save many lives. We request you to donate whatever you can towards this endeavor as it will help someone in dire need. Millions of people are suffering in our country itself.

This gives her rash-free sustainable periods for 3 years. In this phase we will be impacting 5000 waste pickers across Mumbai,Delhi, Pune, Surat, Coimbatore, Chennai, Noida, Odisha and rural areas of Karnataka﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿The challenges female sanitation workers face:In India, about 80% of the waste pickers are women, according to a study.Every month, during periods, women sanitation workers suffer from frequent infections, rashes and bruises on their thighs because of many hours of walking and inaccessibility of toilets. In order to manage their menstrual days they have to depend on inferior, unhygienic alternatives. For good quality products they have to depend on an external provider for supplies.The Covid 19 pandemic has made the situation even worse. Their incomes have declined with increase in work due to the huge amount of waste disposed off from hospitals.Why this solution? Buying period products is not a priority product for waste pickers given their low income. Using disposable period products means they have to spend a lot or depend on external sources for supply. Avni Antimicrobial Cloth pads are designed to tackle common issues. Cloth pads are more familiar with low income groups, the anti-microbial feature prevents bacterial infections. They require very less water and regular soap to wash which can be done while washing other clothes. Even if dried indoors there is no buildup of bacteria. All these pads are made in women self-help groups. Impact partners:Avni has partnered with reknowned NGOs for on-ground activation and help amplify the reach1.SWaCH,PuneIndia's first co-operative owned and run by waste pickers and urban poor.

  "story": "Hi everyone, my name is Aishwarya Shivalkar. I am from Mumbai, Maharashtra, I always had a deep interest to learn and explore the field of interior design and architecture. This interest always kept me motivated to pursue all my aspirations in this field.But due to unforeseen events and medical conditions my dad passed away in the year 2016, leaving us in huge medical debts and no money to fund my education or my younger brother’s education. These kinds of situations usually break people down to their worst stage but Looking at my mom, I understood what feminine will power looks like. She showed no sign of giving up. Albeit being a housewife, she took up a job which paid 30 thousand rupees a month and took loans from family members and friends, then successfully supported us to finish our education at the time. Quite the achievement despite the situations, if you ask me. Inspired by her perseverance. I also have been giving my blood, sweat and tears to study really hard so that I could stand by her side and support our small family financially. And it's my wholehearted wish to finally see my mom rest even for a moment and to see her smile.Keeping that in mind I have scored a GPA of 9.30 in my final year of college (Bachelors in Interior and furniture design) and successfully acquired a 1st rank in the interior design department, which added up to my curiosity of exploring interior design and space learning globally. But My wish to pursue higher studies seemed very much blurred to me as we lacked the resources to fund my education, but my dreams and ambitions never permitted me to quit, and I applied to the best university (Savannah college of art and design) which ranks number one in the United States of America for interior and architecture. Successfully I received my admit letter too and on the basis of my under graduation grades, internship, work experience and a design challenge given by the university they generously awarded me a scholarship of $19,000 this made my tuition fee cut down to 50% and increased my urge to still have hopes and proceed with making financial arrangements for the remaining 50% amount, and for the same I applied to many banks but only got one answer that you’ll need to provide us a collateral. Keeping a collateral to acquire the student loan was impossible for me as we had to sell our house to clear my dad’s medical bills. The motive behind why I want to pursue international education is to grasp the global and western cultural values, to recognize both sides' national traditions and international values better, I am inclined to believe that Indian space planning has some contemporary problematic issues which could not be solved by one person but I hope it could be solved person by person and I could be one of the catalysts. By learning about sustainability and implementing it in modern Indian architecture and space planning. I aim to take full advantage of the multidisciplinary curriculum to further arm my mind-ware to make unheard of space planning and interior design solutions, along with interacting and absorbing the faceted cultural community to build meaningful long term connections and broaden my perspective towards being a truly global person. This addition to my profile would boost my overall development and would help me acquire great projects further in life.I understand there are many students like me in this similar situation who have an ambition to pursue higher studies abroad but couldn’t because of financial troubles. Your funds and support",

The communities in Canning, Basanti, Kakdwip, Kultali and Sagar islands around Sunderbans in South 24 Parganas have suffered quite a lot during this lock down situation owing to the outbreak of COVID-19 during last year. The situation though was improving but unfortunately, further rise of Corona cases put the entire State of West Bengal into partial lock down. Substantial number of people including daily wage earner, migrant labourers and persons working in private companies have lost their livelihood and struggling with their families with minimum means of survival. In continuation with the partial lock down in the State, the coastal districts of West Bengal have been hit by cyclone ‘YAAS’ followed by high tide. Wide part of the river embankments have destroyed with heavy rain and high tide. Large number of people have been affected with these two disasters. While people were trying to cope up with the partial lock down situation, the devastation of ‘YAAS’ has washed away all their hopes of survival. The people have lost their agricultural lands, which have been washed away with saline water, and quite a large number of people have lost their living houses as well.The survival of the people is at stake with majority of them having no livelihood options left. They would not be able to cultivate in these lands for at least next one year. These families would require immediate support at this point of time some support to survive.Purpose of This Initiative:At this point of time, Goranbose Gram Bikash Kendra has planned for supporting needy families with dry ration and sanitization kit for survival. It is the call of the hour to support these affected families to overcome the situation and mental trauma. At the same time, this initiative would focus on guiding the families to restore with available livelihood options. Need-based support would be extended to families for rebuilding their houses with tarpaulin, bamboo and other related materials.The entire initiative would be implemented in close coordination with the local administration so that the families can be linked with the schemes and programs of the State Government. It would be ensured that all the families get the benefit of the housing scheme, public distribution system, and health care support from the government.Steps would be taken to safeguard the children, adolescents, and women from all forms of abuse, through the support of the Gram Panchayats and local administration. Cases of child marriage and human trafficking would be addressed through the support of the respective authorities. Prevention of children working as child laborers would also be addressed through this initiative.How Can You Help?You can be a Change-maker in this entire initiative and help the poorest of the poor families in Sunderbans of South 24 Parganas in West Bengal to overcome the trauma and rebuild their lives in a systematic and dignifiedmanner. Your support would certainly help people of South 24 Parganas to combat COVID-19 and devastation caused out of ‘YAAS’ cyclone. Please come forward to share your concerns for the people of Sunderbans in restoring their lives…We are grateful for your help!",

Having no income and already reeling in poverty, they are in dire need of basic supplies for survival.We have identified the most-in-need families and initiated a process to procure everyday grocery items like rice, sugar, tea, lentils, cooking oil, vegetables, soaps, masks and so on. These items will then be made into kits and distributed to poor families in the village especially the destitute, handicapped, isolated elderly persons, lone widows and those who do not possess a ration card and the presently unemployed living below poverty line.We ask that you make a humble contribution to our initiative and lend a hand at this crucial time to the people of Bankikodla. Your contributions can go a long way in helping these individuals and families gain access to food supplies and basic items so that they can get through these troubled times.Thanking you for your constant support!We are grateful for your help!",

  "story": "Our NGO Jankalyan Bahuuddeshiya Sanstha Ramtek Nagpur NGO is based out of NILKAMAL APPT. JAIHIND NAGAR and we are committed to impacting and improving lives for 12 years now. To take our objective a step further, we have begun a crowdfunding campaign to raise 1000000 for the Environment Care / Development. Jankalyan Bahuuddeshya Sanstha has been working towards social upliftment since the organization was established and its key sectors of operation have been spreading awareness on environment conservation, women empowerment, imparting education to the weaker sections of the society, etc.Objectives of the project:To spread awareness about developing &amp; maintaining a clean environment so that our natural treasure can be conserved  To conduct workshops and conferences to sensitize the masses about the importance of nature in our lives  To plant trees in school campuses, along the roads, community centers, parks and on road dividers  Make efforts on Pollution control through liaisioning with MCD and shopkeepers.  To make community people understand about environment problems, the ill effects and future outcomePROJECT SUMMARYAll the greens are turning into ash. She gives us life, nurtures us with her light and shade and we poison her for years…every single day! She gives us the purest form of water and we contaminate her with toxics. She is Mother Earth, who weaves life for us from cradle to grave and we in return destroy her. And every time we give her death, we take a step forward towards our own. Mother Earth has blessed us with life since time immemorial but the unscrupulous behavior of mankind has led to a variety of environmental hazards. The scenes of the movies like “Day After Tomorrow” and “2017” are disbelieving, counter questioning the whole idea in present day’s context with regards to escalating pollution, deforestation, population explosion &amp; diminishing resources. From pollution to population explosion, from destruction of rain forests to the melting glaciers in the Arctic, our environment is dying and we are dying with it. A major environment hazard in waiting, to strike us in the year 2048 is the Collapse of Fish Stock. Overfishing round the world, is leading to extinction of many species of fish and ocean mammals and this collapse will affect the world’s ecosystem in a major way. Major environmental issues are forest and agricultural degradation of land, resource depletion (water, mineral, forest, sand, rocks etc.), environmental degradation, public health, loss of biodiversity, loss of resilience in ecosystems, livelihood security for the poor. It is estimated that the country’s population will increase to about 1.26 billion by the year 2016. Water shortages, soil exhaustion and erosion, deforestation, air and water pollution afflicts in many ways. These include heavy pressure on land, land degradation, forests, habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity. Changing consumption pattern has led to rising demand for energy. We need to save our environment before a day comes when we won’t be able to save ourselves. Ocean Dead Zones are developing, characterized by excessively low oxygen count and more of nitrogen from sewage, factory emissions and farm fertilizers. The most famous dead ocean zone is the Gulf of Mexico, where excess toxic sludge has flown into the sea. The ice is melting and the average temperature of the Arctic is rising twice as fast as any other region of the world. Global warming is getting accelerated by the contraction of the Arctic ice cap. One of the worst environment hazards is Ozone Depletion, the main cause being release of Chlorofluorocarbons. The use of plastic bags has been banned worldwide and every country is trying to conserve the ozone layer of our atmosphere. The final outcomes of these are air pollution, global warming, climate change, water scarcity and water pollution. One tree can give life to ten families; one stream can quench the thirst of a hundred throats. Go Green is the new mantra because no mortal can alter it an inch when nature comes in its best or at its worst. A new slogan ‘Hug a Tree’ should be practiced by each one of us by planting and conserving tree saplings &amp; plants to let our future generations witness the nature in its best form. We go to find traces of water on the moon but do we try to find those areas on our earth that don’t receive even a drop of rain for years? It’s high time we save Mother Earth, else if She dies, we will die in her womb too. The proposed project on “Awareness Generation on Environment Conservation &amp; Tree Plantation Programme” in Nagpur, Maharashtra aims to sensitize people of Ramtek taluka that conserving our environment is the utmost need of the hour. Tree plantation drives would be carried out and the beneficiaries would plant saplings at parks, inside school campuses, hospital compounds, around houses and community areas. Trees would also be planted along the roadside all over the district. Community members would be stimulated to use cloth / recyclable bags, use dustbins, keep the surroundings clean through regular brooming and avoid water logging through immediate water suction machines by MCD. The NSS members of each school would be given the responsibility to spread awareness and take an active part in the Go Green drive not only inside their school but also in the entire area. The potential beneficiaries would be divided into support groups titled “Green Groups” and each group would be allotted the separate responsibility. The different activities to be undertaken by the group would be Tree Plantation, Pollution control, cleaning bore wells, cleaning marshland and swamps, etc.Total budget of the project: approx. 13 lakhs Total no. of beneficiaries: 5000 direct beneficiaries Duration of the project: 1 yearA team of 1 - 10 are working hard to help us meet our objective of transforming lives.

We have taken him to the doctor &amp; taken a CT scan chest &amp; found the virus is not severe &amp; started medication as per the doctor's prescription. After 4 days of using medicine suddenly in the evening time, he started feeling oxygen-deficient &amp; was unable to breathe &amp; was in full sweating. Noticing this situation immediately we rushed him to the hospital which is 15 km away from their house on the bike as no transport facility is available due to lockdown. After reaching the hospital seeing the situation doctor has given some injections to increase the oxygen levels noticing the oxygen level came down to 85%of saturation level. He advised us to immediately join the patient in the hospital having a bed with oxygen support. But to our dismay, we couldn’t join him in the hospital as there r no vacant beds available for COVID patients. We tried the whole night but all our efforts were in vain. At last, we could get an oxygen cylinder that was not properly functioning. Having faith in God we brought the patient home with the oxygen cylinder which was not properly functioning as it became very late at night. After admitting to the hospital first 3 days he was okay as we have interacted over a video call, from day four the patient's condition got deteriorated &amp; on day five the patient was declared dead by the hospital. All our efforts to save him have gone to waste &amp; even god has not shown any mercy on the patient &amp; his family members.Note:1. He is survived with his wife,3 children (one male &amp; 2 female)&amp; an old mother.2. He is the only earning person in their family &amp; he is a farmer by occupation.3. Along with him all his family members are affected with COVID-19 &amp; his 2nd female child is in critical condition.4. For the COVID-19 treatment around Rupees 10lakhs were expended and were left with nothing for survival.Their family members are kindly looking forward to helping hands to get fully recovered from the Carona virus &amp; start a new life with the amount received from the fundraising campaign.",

  "story": "As the nation continues to fight the battle against coronavirus, people need your support now more than ever before. After hitting the urban areas, the Covid-19 wave has now moved into rural India.“A phase three is inevitable, given the high levels of circulating virus, but it is not clear on what time scale this phase 3 will occur. Hopefully, incrementally, we should prepare for new waves. Previous infections and vaccines will cause adaptive pressure on the virus for new kinds of changes which try to escape, and, therefore, we should be prepared, scientifically, to take care of that,” said K Vijay Raghavan, principal scientific advisor to the Government of India.Another Expert Quoted \"The Spanish Flu hit the world in three waves; it affected 2/3rd of the world’s population before it disappeared. But does this mean coronavirus will disappear after the third wave? No, there is no guarantee. We may see a few more and distinct waves in the coming years. After that, the virus will run out of evolutionary options and settle down as a more benign, endemic pathogen,\"Even your smallest contribution can help save a life! Hospital &amp; Covid Care Centre SupportThe existing medical infrastructure in the country is under a lot of pressure. We must act immediately to take action on the third and more severe wave of Covid-19. We need your help to make our efforts successful! You can help us in meeting the evolving need for oxygen-related supplies including PSA Oxygen Generation plants and equipment including testing machines, ECG, Bi Pap machine, and more at the hospitals and at the special covid care centers.As the Third Wave has hit a few parts of the world already (Singapore &amp; Brazil) and is expected to hit India in the next 3-4 months, we are gearing ourselves to be able to cater to upcoming challenges. The huge number of oxygen concentrators and equipment being used in metropolitans like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore, can be moved to rural India for help now, as the peak is shifted to tier 2 and 3 cities. Ujala Cygnus Hospitals are placed majorly out in tier-2 and tier-3 regions and would be shuffling resources to undertake maximum utilization and saving lives. The government of India is providing resources received through multiple countries in areas of need but till now upkeep and utilization of these resources are constricted due to political reasons. We are not influenced under such criteria and are committed to saving lives with dignity, affordability, and quality for all. In recent times, Hospitals were scrambling to maintain oxygen supply, patients were being turned away due to lack of critical support, and relatives crying for support - you would have come across such stories of horror. In response to this crisis, we have launched this initiative to get support in setting up of oxygen plants in hospitals and save lives. In partnership with various NGOs, we aim to build oxygen plants in our premises for self-sustainable and uninterrupted supply to patients.These plants will not only help during the current Covid crisis but also prepare for any future waves of unprecedented epidemics for years to come. Currently, we are hoping to install 10 oxygen plants at our various hospitals in North India – Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. The requirements of rural and tier-2 and 3 regions are undermined and we have taken this initiative to come forward and gear ourselves to help all. We are already in the process to set up 2 oxygen plants at our hospitals located in Delhi and Karnal. And now we are aiming to set up more oxygen plants.Please help us raise this money. Speed is of the essence as the timeline for installation and market demand is too high now.We are able to accept US$ donations too as we are FCRA compliant. ﻿The Foreign donors can also have tax exemption receipts against the donation done.",

Since families can’t afford basic medication, the brunt of the pandemic has to be borne by these kids.Another girl's father who cannot pay her fees is determined to withdraw her admission because putting food on his family’s plates is a bigger problem he’s struggling with. Some of them are deeply affected by the cyclone and others are battling with medical issues.We've cited some examples of why the funds are a dire need right now. But we are always in need of funds for arranging for basic needs like rations, medical help, devices for online education. To that end, we request you to help us raise some funds – any amount (ANY) will take us a step closer and while we try all we can, consistently – we do need your support.Rest assured that you will be notified of where your funds are being utilized, this will go far and wide, this will reach families, the kids and the amount will be contributed wherever there is a dire need. We’ll be able to tackle all of these issues that have risen due to COVID and ensure that these kids achieve a barrier free education with your support.We are hopeful we can achieve this!",

  "story": "This project aims to assist children (0-8 years) with comprehension, reading, and speech challenges, such as ADHD (attention deficit/ hyperactive disorder) and dyslexia (difficulty in learning to read or interpret words). These challenges can be an obstacle in early childhood development, often impacting a child’s ability to develop memorization, organization, communication, and concentration skills. There are social and emotional impacts as well; children with these challenges are often disregarded and face humiliation from their peers and, in certain cases, their teachers. This leads to issues with developing self-confidence and self-esteem during a child’s most formative years. Adding insult to injury, the educational system in North East (NE) India has zero provisions for such children.The National Education Policy (NEP) promotes early childhood education and indicates the first step to success for ‘every’ child is ‘investment in quality educators,’ which is the need of the hour. We have trained seven teachers and we are currently working with 30 children with special needs. The project is in the preliminary stages and our goal is to expand the program to 100 children and train 35 or more teachers in the first year.My background in Montessori Pedagogy (0-8 years) coupled with 25 plus years of teaching has afforded me the privilege of training hundreds of other fellow educators, during that time, I have experienced children first hand who had difficulties with comprehension, reading, and speech. Deprived of basic testing and diagnosis and limited assistance, they are labelled wrongly as slow learners and traumatically this stigma will most likely remain with them for the rest of their lives. Additionally, our teachers are not equipped to support these children and the student to teacher ratio far exceeds the requirement. The majority of schools in NE India are without appropriate infrastructure, teaching aids and materials, and we are sorely lacking professionals who are trained to assist. Additionally, our teachers as well as principals are not equipped to support these children.The funds received would go towards the following:1.Construction of a children’s activity center, the facility would include programs with an in-depth focus on special needs. (To name a few: reading and language skills, comprehension, ADHD and dyslexia)2.Comprehensive training for pre-primary teachers in the Montessori Methods of Education.3.Offer additional aid, for mastering other areas of education such as singing, dancing, cooking and creative arts, all proven crucial towards child development.4. Annually, our aim is to train 35 teachers and support 100 children but with an emphasis on those who are performing poorly overall.5.Montessori apparatus, Reading tools and Teaching aids. 6.Consultation fees for Speech Therapists and Child Psychologists.7.Staff salaries and Rent.",
